'' congress be `` not use consistent language '' in the commodity law pas in 1974 and since then , justice antonin scalia say . `` they use in , they use on , they use involve . '' minear draw a sharp rebuke from chief justice william rehnquist when he later argue that congress express greater concern about fraudulent use of option than other type of investment under a 1922 commodity trade law . '' perhaps it be true in 1922 but that do n't prove it 's true now , '' the chief justice interject . gary stumpp , dunn 's lawyer , argue that other federal agency such a the security and exchange commission might have jurisdiction over fraudulent foreign exchange trade but not the cftc . several wall street trade group and big bank file friend-of-the-court brief in support of dunn 's position . they warn that if the court uphold the cftc 's position , the burden of additional regulation might drive the gigantic $ 40 billion a day foreign exchange market in the unite state might overseas . on the other side , chicago future exchange say they could be put out of business by unregulated competitor if the court throw out the cftc 's case against dunn . brooksley bear , chairwoman of the cftc , attend the argument but decline to comment afterwards . a decision be not expect for at least a few month . several member of congress have say they may introduce legislation early next year to change the 1974 amendment , possibly render the verdict in the dunn case moot .

a(S"federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on friday urge congress to modernise u .s . financial law but warn that some government oversight must be maintain to avert financial catastrophe . a top priority of regulator , greenspan say after a speech at a federal reserve bank of atlanta conference here , be to prevent `` systemic risk , '' where a problem in one firm or market spread through the financial system and ultimately undermine the entire economy . if a bankruptcy or market crash can not be contain , it could behave like a chain reaction spread through all market , he warn . the failure of drexel burnham lambert in the 1980s , for example , raise fear that it collapse would cause a cascade of failure among large wall street firm and commercial bank that have lend fund to drexel . but the firm be liquidate in an orderly fashion and loss do not spread . use it exist authority to oversee bank and provide loan , the federal reserve have be able to contain previous crisis , greenspan say . `` there have be occasion when we have be on the edge of a significant breakout , '' he say , but decline to name the institution involve . the feed 's action and other rule govern financial firm `` turn out to be adequate to stem the atomic erosion , '' he say , return to the nuclear analogy . '' regulation , by it very nature , become increasingly obsolete , '' greenspan say . `` regulation impose in an earlier period would be wholly or partly inappropriate for something that evolve at a later date . '' congress be currently consider several bill to reform law govern bank , which would affect the feed , which be one of the nation 's primary bank regulator . legislator have also introduce a measure to modernise rule on derivative , financial instrument whose value be base on the value of something else such a a commodity , stock or currency price . '' it be important for congress to periodically review '' such law , greenspan say . `` regulator be require to do that . '' for example , in a recent review of regulation y , govern non-bank interest of bank hold company , the feed find that `` some of that stuff be just unbelievable because the market have change so much , '' the feed chairman say , without elaborate . if congress alter the feed 's responsibility , it should not strip the central bank of it ability to contain systemic risk , greenspan argue . `` have see the inner work of these thing , a lot of the thing we do actually be quite effective , '' he say . '' i would be very chagrin to see some of these power disappear ... i say that from someone who believe the le you interfere in the market , the better . '' under one proposal before congress , the federal reserve would remain a primary regulator of financial institution such a bank . but under other proposal , that authority could be divide among many regulator or entrust to a new committee of federal regulator . the feed offer to provide loan follow the stock market crash of 1987 , for example , prevent a liquidity crisis that could have cause wider problem for the economy . greenspan also appear to side with the treasury department in it long-running dispute with the commodity future trade commission over the appropriate scope of u .s . law govern future trade . under a 1974 amendment to the commodity exchange act , trade of foreign currency and certain other instrument be exempt from cftc oversight . but federal court have make contradictory rule about the scope of the amendment , especially a it relate to derivative , and the supreme court be expect to deliver a rule on the issue soon . greenspan say congress do not need to impose new regulation on trade of derivative over-the-counter by sophisticate institutional investor . `` there appear to be no need , '' he say . regulation under the commodity act `` seem an inappropriate framework , '' he add . even trade by less-sophisticated retail investor `` be more appropriately regulate '' by bank regulator and the security and exchange commission , not the cftc , he say . greenspan 's comment be significant and could affect lawmaker ' decision when they consider relate legislation , an association executive say . '' if you 're go to vote on these issue and you 've be kind of on the fence with respect to pro-market or expansion of cftc ( commodity future trade commission ) power , etcetera , i have to believe that his comment influence that person who 's on the fence , '' say john frawley , chairman of the manage future association . '' so if you 're look for a good housekeep seal of approval , he just sort of stamp it on those who be look for such a thing , '' frawley tell reporter at a brief . "

a(S"the commodity future trade commission , one of the nation 's primary regulator of derivative , have no authority over most foreign currency transaction , the supreme court say tuesday . in a unanimous decision , the court rule that a 1974 law exempt some transaction in foreign currency from cftc oversight also exempt some foreign exchange derivative , financial instrument whose value be base on the value of currency like the dollar or japanese yen . the cftc regulate trade of derivative such a future and option on everything from wheat and corn to interest rat and electricity . by law , such trade must occur on a recogized exchange , such a the chicago board of trade or the new york mercantile exchange . but when congress create the commission in 1974 , it add an amendment permit off-exchange trade in foreign currency and a few other item without cftc regulation . the amendment be request by the treasury department , which believe that the develop market in foreign currency among large bank and security firm would be overregulated by cftc oversight . the cftc stay away from the inter-bank foreign exchange market , which have grow to $ 40 billion a day in total trade . the commission do , however , prosecute small-scale fraudulent foreign exchange investment peddler , often call `` bucket shop . '' but when the cftc pursue william dunn , whose $ 180 million foreign currency fund lose $ 95 million in 1993 , dunn argue that the 1974 treasury amendment should also apply to his trade of foreign exchange option . on tuesday , the supreme court agree with the bulk of dunn 's argument . '' we think it plain that foreign currency option be 'transactions in foreign currency ' within the plain mean of the statute , '' justice john paul stevens write . `` we be not persuade by any of the argument advance by the cftc in support of a narrower read . '' that please bank and wall street trade group , which have side with dunn . they argue that subject their off-exchange foreign exchange trade to cftc oversight would be too costly , force them to shut down u .s . operation and move overseas . '' we 're obviously delight at the result , '' say ken raisler , an attorney for several of the trade group . '' it support our view that the amendment should be read broadly , '' raisler , a former general counsel of the cftc add . dunn 's lawyer and the bank suggest that any wrongdoing in the foreign exchange area could be deal with under exist law by other federal agency , but the supreme court do not address the issue . most off-exchange derivative trade be not directly regulate , although most participant in such market be oversee by bank , security and insurance regulator . the cftc still have jurisdiction over foreign currency derivative trade on an exchange , which include future contract . but that market be dwarf by the over-the-counter market among bank and similiar institution . in a lower court case last year , the cftc argue unsuccessfully that a fraudulent `` bucket shop '' constitute an exchange . on tuesday , the commission maintain that the supreme court have decide only the narrow issue of whether the treasury amendment cover option trade . '' while we be disappoint in the outcome of the case , we note that the supreme court 's opinion be limit to the narrow issue of whether the treasury amendment treat future and option the same , '' cftc general counsel dan waldman say . `` the court 's decision do not affect the commission 's ongoing effort to police fraud against the public in foreign currency trade . '' congress be already discus amend the 1974 treasury amendment . the supreme court 's decision `` underline the need for congress to make decision about what financial product should or should not be subject to the cftc 's jurisdiction , '' say andy fisher , spokesman for the senate agriculture committee . sen . dick lugar , r-ind . , pat leahy , d-vt . , and tom harkin , d-iowa , introduce a senate bill to overhaul future regulation . `` it make the case to proceed with that bill a quickly a we can , '' fisher say . the court invite congressional action . recognise an `` important public policy dispute '' underlie the case , the court suggest `` these argument be address to the congress , not the court .

'' we continue to be disappoint with senator burn ' approach because it do not balance the need of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety , '' undersecretary of commerce william reinsch say . `` we believe there be a market for key recovery product from business who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data .

a(S"top manager in major financial firm need to be razor-sharp if the world 's increasingly complex market be to run smoothly , however sophisticate the regulatory regime , regulator and politician say on thursday . '' management need to know it business . ( it ) set the ethos of the company , '' alistair darling , spokesman on treasury affair for britain 's opposition labour party tell a conference on financial regulation and minimise systemic risk . example of where rule have be break by so-called `` rogue trader '' be a clear sign of management failure , he say . christine cumming , senior vice president at the federal reserve bank of new york , also voice doubt about management 's current ability to deal with regulatory problem . the health of an institution lay in it management and director , but they be not necessarily properly arm to deal with problem when they arise , she say . '' do we prepare director and manager enough ? '' cumming say . britain 's often criticise regulatory system , which rely heavily on so-called `` self-regulation , '' be also under scrutiny . darling say that whichever party win the next general election , due by may 1997 , the british regulatory system `` will be reform . '' but this would not mean `` tear everything up or dramatic change , '' he add . he say labour want to establish a regulator with sufficient `` clout reputation and stature '' to deal with it international counterpart . but it would not create a `` super-sib , '' an enlarge version of the top regulator the security and investment board ( sib ) , a some commentator have suggest . a labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulation . darling 's call for minimise the regulatory burden by make it a cost-effective a possible be echo by most of the speaker at the conference . angela knight , britain 's economic secretary to the treasury , say the government want to see a cost-benefit analysis apply to all regulation . if they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopt , she say . knight also underline the dramatic effect on the industry a a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank bar in february 1995 be `` a more salutory lesson than any regulation '' to other bank and financial institution . there be call from both politician for interchange between industry and the regulator , so that the experience on either side of the fence could be carry across by individual . but while the idea of the regulator be staff by people with first-hand industry knowledge win support from many of those attend the meet , the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movement be see by some a a serious obstacle to this system spread . and while regulator need to keep up with rapid change in financial instrument and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale , they can never be expect to be one step ahead of the business they be monitor . '' regulator should respond to business reality rather than be ahead of business trend , '' sir andrew large , chairman of the sib tell the meet . this would mean regulator become increasingly sophisticate to cope with the change business environment and have to co-operate more and more with their counterpart in other country .

'' i do n't think they be on the critical list in any sense or mean of the word , '' one analyst say . a proposal to sell-off greycoat 's asset be due to be put to shareholder at a special meet on thursday . it have be put forward by the uk active value fund , which be advise by rebel shareholder brian myerson 's active value adviser . uk active value fund buy it 11 percent stake in greycoat three year ago , rescue it from receivership . but myerson 's relationship with the firm 's management have not run smoothly . the south african financier 's challenge to the greycoat management have also trigger a proposal by moorfield estate involve a share exchange offer for the larger greycoat , which have so far dismiss the approach . moorfield say in a statement on monday that it have `` develop a proposal to add value for all shareholder through a strategy of more active management of the asset of greycoat '' . it say this have be present to some of greycoat 's larger shareholder , account for close to 40 percent of the share , and an approach have then be make to greycoat 's chairman . they include merge the two company by a share exchange and restructure the asset of the enlarge group . this would involve a central london portfolio make up initially of greycoat 's main asset , embankment place and 123 buckingham palace road , which would later be demerged . moorfield also intend set up a portfolio of `` investment and development property earmark for immediate disposal to a major property company '' . the remainder of the enlarge group would constitute `` an investment , trade and development portfolio '' and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce cost by `` at least 1.5 million pound ( $ 2.47 million ) per annum '' , moorfield say . while analyst agree the moorfield plan be unlikely to succeed , some say there be an opportunity for greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combine company could capitalise on greycoat 's favourable tax position . '' but they be not go to be flush out by thursday , '' a second property analyst tell reuters , add that three or four company have look `` very seriously '' at the possibility of join with greycoat . another possibility would be a larger group such a british land sweep up greycoat , although such an outcome seem remote in the short-term , analyst say . myerson 's propose sale of greycoat 's london property asset be see by some a an unwise `` force sale '' which would not achieve shareholder value in what be an improve market . '' generally speak a force sale of their asset would not gain anything in the short term , '' the first analyst say , add that with rental growth start to show through , it make sense to hold onto greycoat 's two largest property . '' they be vulnerable to any change in market condition , but it would be a mistake to be force into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale . it would be totally counterproductive , '' he add . but others say the time be right to sell off greycoat 's largest asset . `` this be exactly the right time of the cycle ( to sell , '' the second analyst say . greycoat share close 6.5 penny higher at 155.5 penny while moorfield share be unchanged at 30.5 penny . ( $ 1=.6069 pound ) "

a(S"the reserve bank of australia 's ( rba ) rate cut on wednesday be expect to further squeeze bank margin a competition have force them to pas this cut on to their mortgage customer sooner than usual . the major bank have previously delay pas on the effect of official rate cut to their variable rate home loan customer by around seven week . they would , however , often begin lower variable and fix deposit rat immediately , provide a temporary widen of their margin . wednesday 's rate cut have see the major bank shorten this delay in pas on the rate cut to about five and half week . analyst and some of the bank say increase competition from non-bank mortgage lender and the regional bank have be the major factor in this contraction . they also say they expect this gap to narrow further when further official rate cut be make next year . '' the implication be a bite more pressure on margin , '' say abn amro hoare govett bank analyst michael pulman . '' this all about competition , '' he say . '' these competitive force will end up contract it down further , possibly down to 30 day , '' say aussie home loan manage director john symond . aussie , the biggest of the non-bank lender fund by mortgage origination , say on wednesday it would cut it variable rate to 7.49 percent from 7.99 percent from january 28 for exist customer , a gap of 48 day after december 11. at the time of the last official rate cut on november 6 , aussie plan a gap of 46 day , which be lower than most of the bank . in response to aussie and competition from regional bank like st george bank ltd , the large bank have cut back this delay . national australia bank ltd say it would cut it variable mortgage rate to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent from january 23 for exist borrower , a gap of 43 day . after the last official rate cut nab 's gap be 54 day . in line with this trend , westpac bank corp 's gap have drop to 37 day from 41 day and commonwealth bank of australia 's gap have drop to 48 day from 54. the australia and new zealand bank group ltd have yet to announce any cut in variable mortage rat in response to the rba 's cut in the official cash rate to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent . the biggest move in the gap come from st george , which reduce the time it would pas on the rate cut for it major variable rate product to 20 day from 55 day . st george have even say exist customer of it no frill variable rate product would receive the cut from december 18 , a week away . this product provide 20 percent of it portfolio . overall the average gap for the bank who have cut their mortgage rat have drop to 40 day after this rate cut from 49 after the november 6 cut , which be also by 50 basis point . there may , however , be a limit to how much further this gap can fall , analyst and the bank say . a new regulatory code on credit specify customer must be give 30 day notice whenever their interest rat be change , create an artificial barrier both up and down . '' i think 30 day will about see it out , '' say aussie 's symond . analyst say the bank may try other tactic to cushion the effect of this reduction in the gap , but that it would still further reduce already-bruised margin . '' it will have an effect on margin , '' say bnp equity ' bank analyst linda lyon . '' they 'll do all sort of other thing to cushion the effect . they 'll be try to reduce their deposit rat a far and a fast a they can , '' say abn amro 's mike pulman .
