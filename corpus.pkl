(S'The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.\nThe National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.\nThe league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.\nThe site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.\n"Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information," said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch "has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy."\nIn May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.\nFraud reports from the league\'s site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.\nThe second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.\nIn third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.\nOther top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.\nThe League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.\n'

a(S'The U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday a plan to boost online commerce by enhancing the security and reliability of electronic mail traveling on the Internet.\nUnder the plan, businesses and consumers can verify that e-mail has not been tampered with and use services now available for ordinary mail like sending a certified letter.\n"The leap from trading messages to buying and selling goods has been blocked by the fear of security threats," Robert Reisner, vice president of stategic planning, said.  \n"To expand from local area networks and bilateral secure communications to wide use of electronic commerce will require a new generation of security services," Reisner said.\nCylink Corp is developing a system for the Post Office to use to verify the identity of e-mail senders. The system will enable people to register a digital "signature" with the Post Office that can be compared against electronic mail they send.\nIf any tampering is discovered, the Postal Service would investigate, just like it investigates tampering with regular mail, Reisner said.  \nThe Post Office is also using the Internet to enhance non-electronic mail delivery.\nIn conjunction with Sun Microsystems, the Postal Service has also developed a new online system for bulk mailers that relies on Sun\'s Java computer language, Reisner said.\nInstead of manually calculating postage rates for bulk mailings, possibly using outdated forms, a bulk mailer will be able to add up the charges using a software application written with Java and posted on the Internet.  \nEventually, the Post Office plans to offer hybrid services involving both kinds of mail, Reisner said.\nElectronic mail could be converted to paper and delivered within one business day, for example. Or someone who moves could register a change of address with the Post Office over the Internet.\nCritics of the Post Office\'s Internet plans have said the service is usurping functions that could be better performed by the private sector. But Reisner rejected those arguments, maintaining that the Post Office has often facilitated the spread of new technologies, such as railroads and aircraft.  \n"Remember the pilots who returned from World War I and then risked their lives in an even more dangerous duty," Resiner said refering to early airmail delivery efforts.\n"To keep these daring pilots alive, the Postal Service had to create parts of what we know as the weather service today. Navigation aids had to be developed. We are watching many of these same dynamics today. Earlier experience tells us that this is a public and private job."\n--202-898-8312\n'

a(S'An influential Internet organisation has backed away from a proposal to dramatically expand the number of addresses available on the global computer network.\nThe Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, announced this week that instead of moving ahead with the proposal it would form a nine-member committee to study the issue.\nUnveiled in August, the proposal was an attempt to quell the growing number of disputes over desirable address names.\n"There just seems to be no consensus at all," said Don Heath, president of the society. A variety of objections and questions have been raised about the August proposal, from technical networking issues to concerns about protection for trademarks and intellectual property.\n"We thought we should try to pull it all together and have a good cross-section of people to discuss it and see if we can\'t reach a consensus," he said.\nThe new committee ought to finish its work by early next year and new names could be doled out four to six months later, Heath said. The committee could decide not to go forward with any address expansion, but Heath said that was an unlikely outcome.\n"The facts of life are that people want descriptive names and vanity plates," Heath said.\nDisputes over Internet names are occuring with increasing frequency as more companies seek to publicise and market their products over the Net.\nFor example, Viacom Inc.\'s MTV cable music channel fought with one of its employees who had registered "mtv.com," eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.\nEvery site on the World Wide Web must have a unique address name. Most addresses end with one of a few three letter designations, known as top-level domains, including "com" for private sites, "gov for government sites and "edu" for sites run by schools.\nIn August, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority said it would oversee the creation of up to 150 new top level domains, easing the squeeze, especially for names in the private sector category.\nThe authority, operating under charter from the society and the Federal Network Council, is the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards.\nThe society\'s board of trustees voted in June to accept a preliminary version of the numbers authority proposal, with the proviso that the business aspects of proposal be fleshed out.\nBut with the ensuing controversy, the society decided a committee was needed to reexamine the proposal, Heath said. The committee will meet confer mostly by telephone and online, though an open forum is planned for mid-December in California.\nThe committee will include two members appointed by the society, two by the numbers authority and two by the Internet Architecure Board.\nThe International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association will each appoint one member.\n'

a(S'When a company in California sells a book to a consumer in Canada from a Web site hosted on a computer in England, what laws govern the transaction?\nAs sales of all kinds of goods over the Internet continue to grow, questions are multiplying about basic regulations covering consumer protection, taxation and other issues.\n"Most commercial law has built in a hidden assumption of geographical boundaries within which certain kinds of actions will occur," said Jerry Kaplan, who runs an Internet site called OnSale that auctions electronic merchandise. "Now the legal system is facing a medium which is inherently boundary-less."\nFor example, some states tax transactions that originate within their borders while others hope to collect so-called use taxes when their residents buy from out-of-state merchants. "Sin" laws on obscenity, gambling and sales of alcohol also differ from state to state and apply to some Web merchants.\nWith the potential for so much confusion, some online mavens argue the federal government should step in and set clear policies.\n"The role of the federal government is to set national standards or national policy," said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications and a leading analyst of online companies. "A lot of what we\'re talking about online transcends state borders and even national borders."\nA top priority is protecting consumers\' private information.\n"More regulation is really needed on the privacy issues compared to other areas," said Jonathan Rosenoer, an attorney and author of the online "Cyberlaw" column. Existing laws protect some kinds of records, like medical data, but not other information, Rosenoer said.\nBoth real and imagined privacy violations are feeding public sentiment in favour of reform. Lexis-Nexis was deluged with protests last month after word spread that the database company was selling personal information such as social security numbers and maiden names over the Internet.\nThe company responded that its P-TRAK product no longer provided social security numbers and never contained maiden names. But it withdrew the names of thousands of individuals that asked to be deleted.\nFollowing the controversey, the Federal Trade Commission asked Congress to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law governing personal financial information held by credit agencies. The commission suggested the law be extended to cover nonfinancial information like social security numbers.\nIn many cases, however, the federal government is still deciding what steps to take.\nThe Treasury Department, which has a hand in tax policy, banking regulation and international trade, has several groups studying online commerce issues but has not reached any conclusions yet.\nTop Treasury officials and banking regulators have expressed a desire not to intrude on the nascent market for electronic money. Some banks would like federal rules barring non-banks from issuing electronic money.\n"Heavyhanded, pre-emptive attempts to regulate these products before any social risks have been demonstrated would handicap innovation," Federal Reserve Gov. Edward Kelley said earlier this month.\nThere is little confusion about criminal scheming online, however. The Federal Trade Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are all prosecuting online crooks and collecting complaints at their Web sites.\n"It\'s not an area where we need new laws or new authority," John Stark, special counsel of Internet projects at the SEC said. "It\'s the same swindles, just in a different medium."\n'

a(S'U.S. laws governing the trillion dollar futures markets could be rocked by the Supreme Court\'s interpretation of the word "in" in a case to be argued Wednesday. But a legislative solution is in the offing.\nAt issue is a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, the primary law regulating trading of futures contracts on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity.  \nFutures exchanges say a broad reading of the amendment would put them out of business, while major banks argue a narrow reading would force them to move vast operations out of the United States.\nWhatever the outcome, Congressional action is expected next year. "It\'s certainly significant, but I suspect that at the end of the day, legislation will overtake this," said Howard Schneider, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission general counsel.  \nWhen Congress expanded the commodity act in 1974 to cover futures on non-agricultural commodities and created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police the markets, some big banks objected.\nThey argued the law should not apply to trading of foreign currency, government securities and similiar items already flourishing among banks and securities firms.\nThe Treasury Department agreed and in a letter to Congress suggested an amendment to the law that became known as the Treasury Amendment.  \nThe amendment says "transactions in" foreign currency, security warrants, repurchase options, government securities and a few other items are exempt from the Commodity Exchange Act unless they involve sale for future delivery conducted "on a board of trade."\nThe banks continued to trade foreign currencies unimpeded but the CFTC began to encounter a new problem. Unscrupulous "bucket shops" that peddled off-exchange commodity contracts to rip off unsuspecting investors were expanding into foreign currency schemes.  \nThe CFTC shut down the forex shops but lawyers for the shops argued forex investment contracts should be considered transactions "in" foreign currency and exempt from CFTC rules.\nLower federal courts took up the issue but reached conflicting conclusions. Some said "transactions in foreign currency" exempted dealings only with actual currencies, not derivatives on the currencies like futures and options. Others decided that "in" exempted all trading involving currencies.\nThe Supreme Court will likely resolve that conflict in Wednesday\'s case concerning William Dunn, the manager of a $180 million hedge fund investing in foreign currencies.  \nIn November, 1993, Dunn told his investors he had lost $95 million. The CFTC soon charged Dunn with fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act. A lower court agreed.\nAsking the Supreme Court to uphold that decision, CFTC lawyers argue that Congress would have used the word "involving" rather than "in" if it had wanted to exempt forex derivatives.\nBut Dunn\'s lawyers and four banks that dealt with his fund maintain that the CFTC has no jurisdiction to prosecute under the commodity act.  \nAffirming the earlier decision would undermine the $40 billion a day global currency market by subjecting it to unworkable regulation, the banks said. And Dunn, if guilty of any misconduct, could be prosecuted under wire fraud or securities laws, the banks said.\nAt the other extreme, the Chicago futures exchanges appear terrified the court will strike down the lower court ruling.  \nChicago Board of Trade, in an amicus brief written in part by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, warned that a broad reading of the exemption would create havoc, allowing unregulated dealings in all kinds of futures contracts now traded on exchanges.\n"The idea that someone could clone the Board of Trade\'s principal products, trade them off-exchange and not be subject to any regulation is pretty darn troublesome," Mark Young, another exchange attorney, said.\nA ruling is not expected for months, but the banks and exchanges will have to continue their struggle in the legislative venue almost immediately.\nCongress could resolve the dispute through legislation, which would render the decision moot. One bill was introduced in the last Congress to amend the Treasury Amendment and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) has said he will likely offer a new bill early next year.\n-- 202-898-8312\n'

a(S'Supreme Court justices Wednesday sharply questioned rules governing so-called derivative investments and foreign currency trading in a case that could have wide repercussions for both markets.\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has traditionally prosecuted crooks who ripped off the public with fraudulent investments. But sophisticated investors such as big banks have been allowed to trade similiar financial instruments with little direct regulation, market participants said.\nThat distinction has been blurred in recent years, as defendants accused of fraud by the CFTC have sought to rely on an exemption from regulation, relied on by the bigger players, in a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe amendment was added at the request of the Treasury Department to ensure that sophisticated investors trading in foreign currency and a few other markets would not be subject to uneccessary regulation by the CFTC.\nLower courts have made conflicting rulings about the 1974 amendment and the Supreme Court decided last year to hear the case of William Dunn, a foreign currency investment advisor charged with fraud by the CFTC after losing $95 million of his clients\' money.\nJeffrey Minear, assistant to the Solicitor General -- the federal government\'s representative before the Supreme Court -- defended the CFTC\'s prosecution of Dunn before the court Wednesday. Minear argued that the 1974 exemption for "transactions in foreign currency" did not cover Dunn\'s trading in foreign currency options, one type of derivative. A derivative is an investment whose value is derived from a stock, bond, currency, commodity or other instrument.\nBut justices questioned Minear\'s distinction, which relied heavily on the particular meaning of the word "in."\nCongress was "not using consistent language" in the commodity laws passed in 1974 and since then, Justice Antonin Scalia said. "They use in, they use on, they use involving."\nMinear drew a sharp rebuke from Chief Justice William Rehnquist when he later argued that Congress expressed greater concern about fraudulent use of options than other types of investments under a 1922 commodity trading law.\n"Perhaps it was true in 1922 but that doesn\'t prove it\'s true now," the chief justice interjected.\nGary Stumpp, Dunn\'s lawyer, argued that other federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission might have jurisdiction over fraudulent foreign exchange trading but not the CFTC.\nSeveral Wall Street trade groups and big banks filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Dunn\'s position. They warned that if the court upheld the CFTC\'s position, the burden of additional regulation might drive the gigantic $40 billion a day foreign exchange market in the United States might overseas.\nOn the other side, Chicago futures exchanges said they could be put out of business by unregulated competitors if the court throws out the CFTC\'s case against Dunn.\nBrooksley Born, chairwoman of the CFTC, attended the argument but declined to comment afterwards.\nA decision is not expected for at least a few months. Several members of Congress have said they may introduce legislation early next year to change the 1974 amendment, possibly rendering the verdict in the Dunn case moot.\n'

Differing surveys have come up with widely varying numbers.\nThe Harris poll found that, although more people are getting wired, they are on average spending less time in cyberspace.\nHome users said they were online 2.8 hours a week, down from three hours a week in an April survey. Business and other users said they were online for 1.8 hours, down from two hours in April.\nThe poll also reinforced findings of earlier studies showing that more educated people were more likely to use computers and access the Internet.\nPeople with college and graduate degrees were twice as likely to use computers and four times more likely to access the Internet as people who only graduated from high school, the poll found.\nThe poll\'s results were based on a telephone survey of 1,032 adults at the end of September and have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, according to Harris.\n'

a(S'Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a new plan Monday to boost sales of computer encoding technology, considered a key component of global communications and the development of commerce over the Internet.\nThe plan is intended to foster the growth of online commerce worldwide while still abiding by strict U.S. export laws limiting the sale of encryption products abroad.\nSales of goods and services over the Internet are booming but still lag well behind traditional sales by telephone or in person. Some businesses say that consumers are nervous about sending credit card numbers or other sensitive information over the Internet, where it could be intercepted by criminals.\nEncryption scrambles information, such as a credit card number, while in transit so that it can be read only by the intended recipient using a password or a software "key."\n"The bad news is that, unless you encrypt your information, it\'s very easy for electronic eavesdroppers to have a look at what you\'re transmitting," said Brad Silverberg, senior vice president at Microsoft Corp., a Hewlett-Packard partner in the new encryption framework.\nThe Hewlett-Packard plan is "the first government-approved encryption framework removing a significant barrier to making the Internet secure for business transactions and electronic communications," company Chief Executive Officer Lewis Platt told a news conference in Washington.\nIntel Corp., another partner in the effort, said it plans to incorporate encryption into its market-leading computer hardware products.\nFederal export laws prohibit the sale of strong encryption technology outside the United States. Last week, President Clinton signed an executive order liberalising but not eliminating the export rules.\nCompanies will be allowed to sell products with strong, built-in encryption features but only if the products also contain a feature that allows the government to break the codes when acting under a court order or similiar authority.\nThe administration said law enforcement authorities need the ability to decode messages by having access to the software keys, a system called key recovery or key escrow, in order to keep tabs on criminals and terrorists.\nUnder the Hewlett-Packard framework, powerful encryption features in a new computer or software could be automatically disabled if the product is sold abroad and does not permit government decoding.\nThat may not be enough to satisfy those opposed to the administration\'s policy, including some businesses and civil libertarians.\n"It\'s not a solution for us," said Shari Steele, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group that focuses on cyberspace issues. She said people should have the right to use encryption free of government-mandated escrow.\n"The government is just strong-arming some companies by saying if you want to use strong encryption at all, you have to have key escrow," Steele said.\n'

a(S'The growing business of doing business on the Internet poses a major challenge to tax collectors, but no special taxes should be imposed in cyberspace, the government said in report released Thursday.\n"Treasury believes that these new technologies should not be used to justify new taxes," the Treasury Department draft report said. "Accordingly, Treasury is not considering any type of value added tax, \'bit tax,\' or other new excise tax on electronic commerce."\nInstead, the current system should evolve to tax income from all sources in a consistent manner, the department said.\n"Our overall tax policy goal in this area should emulate policy in other areas -- maintain neutrality, fairness and simplicity -- a policy which serves to encourage all desirable economic activity new and old," the report said.\nBusinesses are already struggling with tax proposals from state and local governments, according to Kent Johnson, head of sales and transaction tax practice at KPMG Peat Marwick.\n"State governments don\'t feel the same way as the federal government, but this report may be a good starting point for discussing all the issues," Johnson said.\nThis year, about $1 billion of goods and services will be sold online, growing to over $7 billion by the year 2000, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.\nBut the myriad tax laws and regulations affecting businesses may not keep pace with the fast-paced, often chaotic growth of the worldwide computer network.\nBuyers and sellers on the Internet can be in different states or even different countries, complicating the task of collecting tax at the "source" of a transaction.\nThe department also said it was worried that tax evaders could use the anonymity provided by the Internet as a mask to avoid reporting income or to transfer money to offshore bank accounts.\nBut the report made no recommendations about how the government should deal with tax evasion issues. "Treasury intends to study, and requests comments on these issues," the report said.\nThe report is available on the Treasury\'s web site, http://www.ustreas.gov.\nThe report on taxation is likely to be followed by reports on other aspects of online commerce that the department is studying, including consumer protection, electronic money, bank regulation and law enforcement, officials said.\n'

a(S'A leading software industry group is backing away from its early support of the Clinton Administration\'s new policy to ease export rules on computer encoding technology.\nIn a letter to vice president Al Gore, the Business Software Alliance, which includes Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp\'s Lotus Development, warned that rules implementing the new encryption export policy appeared to be flawed.  \n"It appears that significant backtracking has occurred since the October 1 announcement," the alliance wrote.\n"Therefore, we seriously doubt that the regulations will work, meet consumer demands or be accepted by the private sector unless the administration radically changes its approach immediately," the alliance added.\nA spokeswoman for Gore said Greg Simon, the vice president\'s chief domestic policy adviser, and other administration officials working on the rules have met with the software group to discuss the criticism.  \n"There is still an internal decision making process going on," spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. Final rules are expected by January 1, she said.\nThe administration is attempting to craft a compromise on export sales of products containing encryption, computer programs that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key."\nUnder current laws dating from the Cold War, products for export can only include very weak coding features.  \nBut with the growth of the Internet and online commerce, encryption is spreading as a means to ensure secure communication between businesses and to safeguard consumers\' credit card numbers.\nU.S. software companies argue they are losing substantial overseas sales to foreign companies not bound by the export laws.\nU.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials counter that the spread of sophisticated encryption will make their jobs far more difficult.  \nUnder the compromise policy announced in October and enacted in an executive order last month, companies would be able to export strong encryption but only if the products also contained a feature known as "key recovery" that would permit the government to decode scrambled data.\nThe software alliance said in October that the new policy was a "step in the right direction." In its letter this week, however, the alliance said it was not happy with the rules being drafted to implement the policy. "Everything we have seen and heard to date reveals that the government is headed in the absolute wrong direction," it said.  \nPart of the debate revolves around the definition of key recovery. The alliance said key recovery should consist of products which allow the government to decode stored communications, such as an E-mail message saved on a computer hard drive. But products should not be required to allow government decoding of real-time communications.\n"There is little if any commercial demand for key recovery function in real-time communications," the alliance wrote. "Our members have seen nothing to suggest that any product developed to date can work on a mass market scale or that there is significant commercial demand for such products."\nA number of companies, including Microsoft and IBM, have announced products designed to meet the new export policy. But not all of them easily allow real-time key recovery.\nAlthough Microsoft is trying to create products to meet the export policy, "we still feel government should liberalize the policy more," John Browne, head of the company\'s Internet commerce group, said.\n-- 202 898-8312\n'

a(S'A U.S. District Court judge Wednesday barred new federal regulations that allow credit unions to expand their membership beyond workers at one company, saying this would exceed the legal limits of the institutions.\nThe rules have raised the ire of banks who, fearing the loss of customers, have been battling in court since 1990 to keep credit unions to their traditional role of serving members of just "one" community or occupation.\nThe new rules, which the National Credit Union Administration adopted last month after an unfavorable court ruling, redefined "a single common bond" that is the basis of credit union membership.\nOn Wednesday, Judge Thomas Jackson issued an injunction blocking the new rules, saying they were merely an attempt to circumvent earlier court rulings.\nEarlier court rulings limited members of a credit union to a single company or organization. The court actions struck down a 1982 NCUA decision allowing credit unions to draw members from multiple companies.\nUnder the latest NCUA rules, credit unions could include members of a single trade, industry or profession even if the members worked for different companies.\nJackson chastised the NCUA and said the federal credit union regulator was acting more like a trade association.\nJackson also said the agency must rescind 31 applications that it had already approved for credit union charters under the new rules.\nThe judge said he might refer the matter to the attorney general for further investigation of what he termed collusive behavior among the agency and credit unions.\n"Why did you go about it in such a surreptitious, collusive, underhanded way?" Jackson asked lawyers for the agency at a hearing Wednesday.\nEric Goulian, a lawyer for the Justice Department, denied the agency had acted improperly and said the new rules were a response to emergency conditions.\nThe fireworks were the latest development in a six-year-old case before Jackson pitting the American Bankers Association against the agency and the credit union industry.\nIn 1990, the ABA and five North Carolina banks filed suit againt AT&amp;T Family Federal Credit Union, which had grown to encompass members from more than 150 different occupational groups.\nIn July, a U.S. Court of Appeals handed the banks a major victory in the case, ruling that the NCUA had exceeded its statutory authority in allowing single credit unions each to serve members of more than one employer.\nJackson issued injunctions in October implementing the ruling. The injunctions limited more than 3,500 non-profit credit unions nationwide to members who share a "single common bond."\nThe credit union industry has said the injunctions will result in millions of people being expelled from credit unions, with some unable to afford similiar but more expensive services from banks.\nTwo weeks after Jackson issued the injunctions, the credit union agency adopted new rules, now set aside, to dramatically expand the definition of a single common bond.\nThe new rules also allowed credit unions to have as many as 1 million members, up from 25,000 under the old rules.\nAfter the hearing, Brenda Furlow, general counsel for the Credit Union National Association, said the industry was considering an appeal.\n"Clearly, we\'re disappointed with the ruling," she said. "Basically, banks are trying to aggressively protect their competitive interests and the American consumer loses."\nPaul Schosberg, president of the trade association America\'s Community Bankers, praised Jackson\'s ruling. "The NCUA has clearly stretched the law\'s common bond requirement beyond all recognition," he said.\n'

a(S'The Internet could provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy if the federal government pursues "free market" policies in cyberspace, a group of President Clinton\'s top advisers says in a draft report obtained by Reuters.\nThe group, an interagency task force headed by senior presidential adviser Ira Magaziner, recommended that the administration work globally to protect the Internet from new taxes, censorship and other onerous forms of regulation.\nAfter seven months of deliberations, the task force is preparing to issue for public comment a report of principles and policies the Unites States should pursue, Magaziner said in an interview.\n"One of the things we\'re trying to do with this paper is as much say what government should not do as say what they should do," Magaziner said. "A lot of what industry is concerned about is that governments are already beginning to take actions around the world that would inhibit commerce."\nThe growth of Internet commerce could help boost U.S. exports of everything from movies and news to software and consulting services. Exports of such products totalled $40 billion in 1995, the draft report noted.\nThe idea is to hitch U.S. exports to the speeding Internet commerce train. Sales of goods and services online are projected to grow to $7 billion in the year 2000, from about $1 billion this year, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.\n"Companies have told us there would be a tremendous potential to increase world trade across the Internet if we could provide the right kind of environment," Magaziner said.\nThe draft report, called "A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce," covers nine issues, from taxation and customs to privacy and security.\nOn taxation, the draft report echoes a report issued by the Treasury Department last month by stating no new taxes should be imposed. Acting through the World Trade Organisation, the United States should push for the Internet to be designated a duty-free zone, the draft said.\nSome consumers worry that their privacy will be violated when they shop online. The report said governments should push vendors to disclose what will be done with information about consumers rather than dictate to merchants what they can or cannot do with the data.\nOn some issues, such as encryption -- encoding information in a scrambled format to provide a measure of security or privacy -- existing administration policies may be seen as conflicting with the free market approach of the draft report.\nMagaziner said policies will evolve over time, "but the paper will reflect where we are now."\nMagaziner headed Clinton\'s failed effort to reform the U.S. health care system, an initiative critics said favoured government over the private sector.\nWhile disagreeing with his critics\' characterisation of the health care plan, Magaziner said the Internet "is a wholly different animal.\n"I\'m a problem solver, not an ideologue," he said.\n'

a(S'The Clinton administration will modestly revise controversial export rules for computer encoding technology after a private meeting Wednesday with computer and telecommunications companies, a top Commerce Department official said.\n"This is a work in progress," Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said in a telephone interview after the hour and a half long meeting. "There will be some changes that will be more than technical."  \nThe administration circulated a draft this week of new rules that would overhaul Cold War era export limits on products containing encryption, computer programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key."\nWith the growth of the Internet and online commerce, demand for encryption-capable products is growing worldwide. Coded messages can keep a business\' e-mail confidential or protect a consumer\'s credit card number sent on the Internet.\nReinsch and others who attended Wednesday\'s meeting said the tone was civil.  \n"We had a long meeting but it was actually quite a constructive one and actually also a polite one," Reinsch said.\nIndustry officials argued at the meeting that the draft rules were unclear or unworkable on a number of points.\n"In some cases we could tell them what we meant which made them feel better and now we\'ll go off and try to fix it," Reinsch acknowledged. "In other cases we\'re going to have to think a little more about what they said and in some cases I\'m not sure there is a way to fix it."  \n"We are not optimistic that these (rules) will be turned around and we feel going to Congress is our only option," Smiroldo said. The alliance includes a dozen large software firms including Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp\'s Lotus Development.\nSeveral bills that would dramatically ease encryption export limits were introduced in the last Congress and are expected to be revived next year.\nAmbassador David Aaron, appointed by President Clinton as special envoy for cryptography last month, also attended the meeting, Reinsch said.\nThe draft rules implement an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton last month. Under the order, limits on export of products containing strong encryption would be eased if the products allowed the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the keys.\nThe draft rules detail for the first time the government\'s definition of acceptable key recovery features and other aspects of the revised export approval process.\nFor example, until 1999, companies will be allowed to export some products that do not include key recovery if the companies promise to include key recovery in future products. -- 202-898-8312\n'

a(S'A break-in at the U.S. Justice Department\'s World Wide Web site last week highlighted the Internet\'s continued vulnerability to hackers.\nUnidentified hackers gained access to the department\'s web page on August 16 and replaced it with a hate-filled diatribe labelled the "Department of Injustice" that included a swastika and a picture of Adolf Hitler.\nJustice officials quickly pulled the plug on the vandalised page, but the security flaws that allowed hackers to gain entry likely exist in thousands of other corporate and government web sites, security experts said.\n"The vast majority of sites are vulnerable," said Richard Power, senior analyst at the Computer Security Institute. "The Justice Department shouldn\'t be singled out."\nJustice Department officials said the compromised web site was not connected to any computers containing sensitive files. The web site (http://www.usdoj.gov) included copies of press releases, speeches and other publicly available information.\nThe security breach "is just like graffiti on the outside of the building," spokesman Bert Brandenburg said.\nOther organisations have been targeted in the past. Last year, the Nation of Islam\'s Million Man March web site was vandalised. And hackers make 250,000 attempts annually to break into U.S. military computers, according to a General Accounting Office report.\nWindows Magazine recently found security flaws at web sites of a dozen major corporations. "The web is spectacularly insecure," editor Mike Elgan said. Relying on security holes that had been documented by software manufacturers months earlier, the magazine\'s specialists were able to gain various degrees of unauthorised access at the different sites.\nElgan said hackers who are exploiting some of the same flaws are motivated by anger over the growth and commercialization of the Internet. "A common theme is that hackers are fed up with non-hackers on the Internet," he said.\nThe battle is not completely hopeless. "You can secure a web site," Richard Power said. "There\'s all kinds of measures you can take. Most corporations and institutions don\'t take them simply because nothing bad has happened to them yet."\nSome sites are using multiple layers of security, well beyond simple password protection, to keep hackers out.\nOne site mentioned by Windows Magazine was Fidelity Investments. Fidelity\'s site advertises its mutual funds and disseminates information about personal finance but does not contain confidential customer information.\nFidelity officials immediately closed the loophole identified by the magazine, a spokeswoman said. But multiple security measures previously in place would have prevented a security breach despite the hole, the spokeswoman added.\n'

a(S'If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks\' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said.\nThe Fed is expected to vote to allow banks\' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.  \nThe section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed\'s thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.\nBoth the Fed\'s proposal and the Comptroller\'s actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  \nIn the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.\n"Now the tables have been turned," Litan said. "But it\'s not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field."  \nBoth moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.\nIn the words of one top regulator, the Fed\'s move from 10 to 25 percent, "is not material." The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.\nCompetitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.\nComptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary "basically eliminates any subsidization."\nHe opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. "It\'s a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace," he said.\n((--Aaron Pressman, 202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'The Federal Reserve took another step Friday toward eliminating the barriers between banking and other financial service industries, voting to allow banks to further invade the turf of Wall Street securities firms.\nThe Fed Board of Governors voted unanimously to increase the percentage of revenue bank subsidiaries may earn from underwriting and dealing in securities to 25 percent from 10 percent.\nBank subsidiaries have been bumping against the 10 percent limit and earlier this year the Fed cited Swiss Bank Corp. for exceeding the cap.\nBanks were elated by the new rule.\n"This is a tremendous boost for banks that already underwrite securities and an incentive for banks considering this business," American Bankers Association managing director Larry LaRocca said.\nSecurities firms, however, were not pleased.\n"It\'s as if Santa Clause delivered all the gifts to only one house in the neighbourhood," said Steve Judge, senior vice president for the Securities Industry Association.\nBruce Thompson, director of government relations at the nation\'s largest brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch and Co., said he hoped the greater latitude given to banks would not reduce the banks\' previous support for Congressional action.\n"We hope this does not reduce their incentive," he said. "The time really is coming for having everyone put aside their own particular interests and support comprehensive reform."\nOfficials at leading banks said they still wanted Congress to take more dramatic action.\n"We need complete financial reform," Rachel Robbins, general counsel of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co, said. "This addresses one piece of it and doesn\'t address it completely but until Congress can act this is a welcome action."\nFor decades, securities underwriting was the exclusive purview of firms like Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers.\nBut since 1987, when the Fed first allowed bank subsidiaries to earn 5 percent of their revenues from underwriting, big banks like J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust have made dramatic inroads.\nWhile the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act generally prohibits banks from engaging in non-bank activity, under section 20 of the Act banks may affiliate with firms not "engaged principally" in such areas. Currently, 41 bank "Section 20" subsidiaries have permission to engage in underwriting.\nThe Fed\'s action will add to pressure on Congress, which was already planning to review the entire scope of financial sector regulation next year.\nSecurities firms, insurance companies and others who opposed lifting restriction on banks in the past will likely favour reform this time around, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.\nRaising the revenue cap, and an announcement last month by the Comptroller of the Currency allowing banks another avenue for entering unrelated fields, only go halfway, Litan said.\n"It\'s not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field," he said.\nAt Friday\'s meeting, Fed governors called for Congress to follow their lead and and revise the laws.\n"We hope that the next move will be up to the Congress in this whole area," Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin said.\n'

a(S'The Federal Reserve Friday rebuffed a request by the Justice Department to allow U.S. banks to collect data about borrowers as part of an effort to discourage racial discrimination in lending.\nThe unanimous decision put the central bank\'s board in the unusual position of being at the center of a national debate about how best to discourage discrimination.\nOn the one side: those who see the collection of data on race, gender, age, religion and other charecteristics as a way to ferret out discrimination. On the other: opponents who view such collection as discriminatory on its face.\nBacked by banking regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Justice Department urged the Fed to change a regulation that prohibits banks from collecting such data except in the case of mortgage lending.\nThe department argued that the lack of data was hindering its ability to evaluate charges of racial discrimination in lending to small businesses.\nIn an unanimous decision, the central bank\'s board voted against changing Fed Regulation B, saying it might lack the authority to act without new legislation from Congress.\n"The issue ... is not some technical matter of law or economics," Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey said.\n"Rather, it is at the center of a heartfelt and ongoing debate in America about the direction of public policy with respect to individual characteristics," he added.\nThe regulation, which was established in 1977, was designed to discourage discrimination by race, gender and age by prohibiting banks from collecting such data from borrowers.\nFed Governor Edward Kelley described the proposed change in the regulation as "social policy of the most profound sort" and said it "provides no answer to the social conundrum that\'s before us."\nThat is not the way the Justice Department sees it. In a letter to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan Friday, Associate Attorney General John Schmidt said changes in the regulation would help combat discrimination.\n"Allowing credit providers to collect certain basic data seems to us to be a useful step toward getting a better handle on the extent of this problem," he said.\nExisting studies, though limited, "do appear to provide some support for the widespread view ... that minority-owned businesses face unusually difficult barriers in obtaining this type of credit," Schmidt added.\nCreditors and their trade associations had opposed the regulation change, which was first released for comment by the Fed in April, 1995.\n'

a(S'An international task force working to resolve the simmering controversy over desirable addresses on the Internet released a draft plan Friday for a substantial expansion of the total number of destinations.\nThe International Ad Hoc Committee on domain names, formed by the Internet Society in October, recommended that seven new so-called top-level domains be added to the Internet.\nTop-level domains are the three-letter designations most Internet sites end with, such as "com" in http://www.gm.com and other commercial sites, "gov" in government sites and "edu" for sites run by schools.\nThe committee recommended that an unlimited number of firms be authorised to register the new addresses, although the panel said it hoped to initially approve 20 to 30 new registration services.\nAddresses for most sites are currently handed out by Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., which charges $100 for each registration.\nAt first, Network Solutions would continue to have a monopoly on the domain names it already controls but the committee said its "ultimate goal" is to have all names handled by all qualifed firms.\n"The IAHC members were faced with a formidable challenge," said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chairman of the committee. "We accomplished our goal, in no small part, because we were able to bring people together from around the world, via the Internet."\nThe full text of the recommendations was posted on the Internet at http://www.iahc.org, Heath said. The proposal will be open for public comment until Jan. 17 and a final report is expected by Feb. 3.\nNew names and competing registration services should help quell disputes over popular or trademarked names.\nDisputes are arising more frequently, usually when the holder of a trademark discovers that someone else is using their trademark as the name of an Internet site.\nFor example, Viacom Inc.\'s MTV music channel fought with one of its employees, who had registered "mtv.com," eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.\nIn another case, a journalist tweaked McDonald\'s Corp. by registering "mcdonalds.com" before the fast-food giant did and before the Web had attained its current prominence. The address now belongs to McDonald\'s.\nOnce new top-level domain names are available, 10 people or organisations could register similar names. The new top-level domains will contain three to five letters but have not yet been selected.\nThe committee included members from the Internet Society, which helps coordinate and develop Net standards; the Internet Assigned Number Authority, which oversees certain of the standards, and the Internet Architecture Board, which helps draft and promulgate new technical standards.\nThe committee also included representatives from the International Telecommunications Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association.\n'

a(S'U.S. banks will be able to significantly increase their securities underwriting activities under a rule adopted Friday by the Federal Reserve, but that will only add pressure on Congress to overhaul the entire regulatory system, market participants said.\nThe Fed voted unanimously to allow so-called section 20 subsidiaries of banks to derive as much as 25 percent of their revenues from underwriting and dealing in securities such as stocks, corporate bonds and commercial paper.\nThe new rule takes effect in 60 days, the Fed said.  \nAt the meeting, Fed governors called for Congressional action to reform the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and other laws separating banks from non-bank financial services industries.\n"We hope that the next move will be up to the Congress in this whole area," Fed vice chair Alice Rivlin said.\n"Legislation is needed but I think this is a constructive step and it is appropriate for us to interpret the existing legislation," Governor Susan Phillips said.\nWhile the Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from engaging in non-bank activity, under section 20 of the Act banks may affiliate with firms not "engaged principally" in such areas.  \nThe Fed said it currently authorizes 41 bank subsidiaries to deal and underwrite securities, ranging from stocks and bonds to commercial paper and mortgage-backed securities.\nBanks were already allowed to handle other sorts of financial instruments, including Treasury securities and over-the-counter derivatives.\nBoth the Fed\'s action and an even broader move last month by the Comptroller of the Currency will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  \nIn the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance and underwriting.

a(S'The Federal Communications Commission proposed Tuesday to trim the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees.\nBut the commission ducked the contentious issue of whether such charges should be imposed on Internet service providers, asking for comment on the issue without offering any proposals.\nIn a notice of proposed rule-making, the commission said it could cut the access fees in either of two ways: it could impose a schedule of long-distance access charge reductions or wait to allow market forces to drive fees lower.\nThe access charges, which make up a substantial portion of local phone company revenues, were adopted after the break-up of AT&amp;T Corp. in 1984 that led to the creation of the regional "Baby Bell" local service companies.\nNew telecommunications rules signed into law in February are supposted to foster more competition for local and long-distance service and drive prices lower.\nLong-distance companies, which say the access fees are excessive, favour deep, government-mandated cuts.\n"We recommend the FCC to move as quickly as possible to squeeze the $10 billion in excess access fees out of the local exchange industry and put it back in the pockets of consumers," AT&amp;T said in a statement.\nLocal phone companies concede that the fees exceed their actual costs for carrying long-distance calls but would prefer a gradual reduction based on competition and market forces.\nThe FCC "must not allow the long-distance companies to continue to benefit at the expense of consumers," said Roy Neel, president of the U.S. Telephone Association, which represents local service providers.\nWhile local providers have already cut access fees by $9 billion, "the long-distance oligopoly has raised rates in lockstep more than six times," he said.\nUnder the FCC\'s market-based approach, new entrants in the local market would compete with the Baby Bells to connect long-distance calls. The FCC would gradually relax and ultimately remove price caps and access fee schedules while relying on competition to drive the fees down.\nThe alternate approach would specify the nature and timing of changes in existing rate levels. Ultimately, the FCC said it could adopt parts of both approaches.\nLocal phone companies also connect Internet users to Internet service providers over local phone lines, but they receive no access charges for those calls.\nRecently, several Baby Bells complained that Internet users were getting a free ride, tying up local lines with often lengthy calls.\nThe FCC did not take a position on whether Internet service providers should be required to pay access fees. In a less formal "notice of inquiry," the agency asked for comment on possible reform "relating to interstate information services and the Internet."\nComments are due by Jan. 27 on the long-distance access fee proposals and by Feb. 21 on the Internet issue.\n'

a(S'The Federal Communications Commission has tentatively decided not impose fees on Internet service providers for use of local telephone lines, an official said Thursday.\nOn Tuesday, the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking setting out two possible plans for reducing the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees.\n"The commission raised the specific question of whether ISPs (Internet service providers) should pay access charges as we currently understand them," Kevin Werbach, counsel for new technology at the commission said. The FCC "tentatively concluded that the answer is no."\nLocal phone companies had pressed to have the access fee applied to Internet service companies. The phone companies argued that consumers using the Internet were getting a free ride and tying up local lines with lengthy calls.\nInternet companies countered that such fees would smother the growth of the booming online industry.\n"We think they did exactly the right thing," said Jill Lesser, deputy director of law and public policy at America Online, the largest online service in the world. "It means the FCC is thinking in the right way about this. They\'re thinking for the growth of the Internet."\nThe commission did issue a "notice of inquiry" asking for comments on the issues involved, Werbach said.\nThe arguments of both sides raise "legitimate issues, so the commission initiated the notice of inquiry to develop a record on that," he said.\nA notice of inquiry seeks comment but does not give the commission authority to then adopt a rule. The commission would have to first issue a notice of proposed rulemaking before applying access fees to Internet service providers, Werbach said.\nThe Internet notice is "more foward looking" than the proposed rules for long distance access fees, Werbach said. "Once we have an idea what replaces the access charge system then we can take a look at that," he said.\n'

a(S'The Commerce Department will issue final rules on Dec. 30 to implement its new policy on export of computer encoding products, but the proposal is unlikely to mollify the software industry and privacy advocates who objected to a draft version.\nSome changes were made in the final rules, available Friday at a government printing office, from the earlier draft. But the bulk of the proposal remains the same, including portions strongly criticized by the software industry that applied to real-time communications.\nCommerce undersecretary William Reinsch had said two weeks ago that the draft rules would be modestly revised, but warned that some objections could not be addressed.\nUnder the previous rules dating from the Cold war, the administration severely limited the export of products containing encryption, programs that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key."\nIn the past, products could be exported using "keys" as long as 40 digital bits, a string of forty ones and zeros. But as the speed of computers has grown, 40-bit keys have become easy to crack and longer keys have come into general use.\nAt the same time, with the growth of the Internet and online commerce, demand for encryption-capable products is growing worldwide. Coded messages can keep a business\' e-mail confidential or protect a consumer\'s credit card number sent on the Internet.\nThe Commerce Department rules were intended as a compromise, allowing U.S. companies to compete in the encryption market while protecting the interests of law enforcement officials.\nThe policy relies on so-called key recovery features which allow government officials to decode encrypted messages when acting under proper legal authority.\nUnder the policy to be issued Monday, products containing key recovery features will be eligible for export after a one-time review.\nSoftware firms had hoped the key recovery exception would only apply to stored data, like a document on a hard drive. But the final rules, like the draft rules, also require key recovery for real-time data transamission such as coded phone calls.\nNon-key recovery software with keys of up to 56 bits will be exportable under six-month, renewable licenses until the end of 1998, but only if the manufacturer commits to producing software with key recovery by then.\nSome companies had complained that the government was asking for too much information about their future plans, but the final rules still require submission of detailed plans and committments.\nAll other encryption products, such as state-of-the art 128-bit software without key recovery features, would continue to be treated as munitions. Such products include ordinary e-mail programs and even the recently introduced set-top box for surfing the Internet with a television.\nThe rules deleted a draft provision allowing keys to be stored with a recovery agent located outside of the United States.\nThe final rules also made clear that an applicant\'s public support of the administration\'s policy would not be a factor in export license decisions. Rather, helping build the necessary infrastructure would be a factor, the final rules said.\nA criteria listed as "public support for a key management infrastructure," was changed to "or other support for the key management infrastructure."\n'

a(S'House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at remaking the regulatory landscape for banking and other financial services in the United States.\nA similiar bill Leach introduced in the previous Congress foundered last June amid opposition from the insurance industry and House Democrats.  \nAnalysts have said this year\'s bill might have a better chance of passage, but that was before Leach decided to oppose Newt Gingrich\'s reelection as Speaker of the House, a move that could turn the leadership against his bill.\n"This bill provides expanded powers for the banking, securities and insurance industries," Leach said in a statement. "The ultimate beneficiaries of this legislation, however, are consumers."  \n"Not only will there be more products available to banking customers who are looking to maximize their savings, but efficiencies should lower industry costs and therefore costs to consumers," Leach said.\nIf passed, the bill would break down the legal barriers enacted after the Great Depression between banks, securities firms and insurance companies.\nBank regulators have already begun eroding the barriers for banks, putting pressure on Congress to level the playing field, analysts said.  \nThe Federal Reserve voted Dec 20 to allow bank subsidiaries to garner a greater share of revenue from underwriting activity. And a month earlier, the Comptroller of the Currency\'s office said it would allow banks to enter an array of non-bank markets.\nLeach said his bill would repeal Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act and amend Section 32 to allow for the merger of commercial and investment banks.  \nBank subsidiaries would be allowed to engage directly in securities dealing and other activities considered "part of and incidental to" banking. Affiliates of bank holding companies, would be allowed to engage in insurance activities as principal, agent or broker.\nThe bill would also abolish the federal charter for thrifts while grandfathering existing thrift holding companies. National thrifts would have the option of transferring to a national or state bank charter or a state savings and loan charter.\nThe Iowa Republican\'s bill would continue to prohibit commercial companies outside the finance sector from owning banks.\nThe bill was also sponsored by three other Republican members of the Banking Committee: Rep Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Mike Castle of Delaware and Rick Lazio of New York.\nThe full committee will hold hearings on the bill and any related legislation in early March, Leach said.\nThe text of Leach\'s bill is available under the "daily update" section of the Banking Committee\'s World Wide Web site, http://www.house.gov/banking/.\n((202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'A computer scientist barred from exporting a floppy disk containing computer encryption programming asked a federal court Friday to strike down the export limits as a violation of his right to free speech.\nPhilip Karn challenged the rules after the State Department in 1994 denied his request to export the programming on disk but allowed him to export the identical material contained in a book.\nU.S. law treats many kinds of encryption, computer coding and decoding programs, under the same category as munitions.  \nThe Clinton administration recently issued new rules relaxing the export limits, but most existing encryption programs remain classified as munitions and are subject to strict export limits.\nThe limits infringed on Karn\'s constitutional rights to free speech and due process, his attorney, Kenneth Bass, told a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Friday.\nThe First Amendment of the Constitution ought to apply equally to computer code written in a book or saved in text form on a floppy disk, Bass argued.  \n"It just cannot be that the Constitution doesn\'t recognize progress," Bass said.\nKarn did not attempt to export "object" computer code, a working program that could be run on a computer to encrypt and decrypt data. Karn\'s disk contained "source" code, or directions that could be used to write such software.\nIn another case, Federal district court Judge Marilyn Patel held last month that source code should be considered a protected form of speech. But the ruling, in the Northern District of California, is not binding on the D.C. Appeals court.\n'

a(S'Fast running out of options, federal credit unions are hoping the Supreme Court will decide Friday to wade into the midst of their six-year legal battle with the banking industry.\nThe Supreme Court\'s nine justices are expected to decide whether or not to hear the credit union case, lawyers involved in the case said.\nThe banks, who filed suit to challenge a 1982 policy adopted by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) relaxing previous membership limits, have urged the court not to take the case.\nLower courts have agreed with banks that membership should be sharply limited at thousands of credit unions, cooperative non-profits that offer bank-like services.\nIf the court decides not to hear the case, membership limits could force many credit unions to be dissolved or broken up into smaller, less-efficient institutions, according to Tim Pryor, federal regulatory counsel to the National Association of Federal Credit Unions.\n"It would be kind of like a court-ordered savings and loan crisis," Pryor said. "This case is extremely important to the safety and soundness of the industry."\nIf at least four justices favour taking the case, the credit unions would have a final chance to erase the limits.\nOral arguments could be scheduled for later this term, with a decision likely by the summer.\n"This is about settled law," said Michael Crotty, counsel for the American Bankers Association. If credit unions want to change the membership limits, they should go to Congress and ask for legislation, he said.\n"The policy of who gets to be a member of a credit union is not a judicial issue but a legislative one," added Crotty.\nUntil 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. But that year, the NCUA began allowing credit unions to include members from multiple, distinct groups.\nThat angered banks, which contended that some of the larger tax-exempt credit unions posed unfair competition. In 1990, the banks sued a North Carolina credit union that had grown to encompass more than a hundred groups.\nThe case wound its way through the system, reaching the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia last year. The court ruled the NCUA had exceeded its authority and that members of each credit union must share a single common bond.\nA lower court then ordered credit unions to stop accepting members from more than one group, although the order was partially suspended until the Supreme Court makes a decision or declines to hear the case.\nThe case, First National Bank and Trust Co. v NCUA et al, is on a list of cases the Supreme Court justices are scheduled to discuss Friday.\nIt is possible that the justices might not get to the case Friday, and then it would likely be discussed at a conference next month, lawyers said.\n'

a(S'The growing mass of Internet users have paid their fair share to local telephone companies and pose little threat to the phone system, according to a study released on Wednesday by a coalition of Internet and computer companies.\nThe coalition presented the report to counter studies by local phone companies released last year seeking to justify new access fees on Internet usage. The phone company studies found that Internet usage threatened to overwhelm the system.  \n"The Internet is not crashing the telephone network," Information Technology Association of America President Harris Miller said at a news conference here.\n"We are bringing the real facts to bear on a \'problem\' that the phone companies have anecdotally created to protect their own interests," said Miller, whose group is a member of the Internet Access Coalition.\nOn December 24, the Federal Communications Commission said it had tentatively decided not to impose access fees on Internet providers similiar to those paid by long distance companies to local phone companies.  \nBut the commission also asked for comments about the effect of the Internet on the phone system.\n"Our findings clearly show that claims of phone network \'congestion\' resulting from Internet traffic and predictions of a \'meltdown\' are greatly exaggerated," said Lee Selwyn, one of the study\'s authors.\nFurther, ordinary consumers using the Internet already pay the phone companies more than enough to cover the cost of increased use, said Selwyn, who is an expert on telecommunications regulation.  \nThe study found, for example, that in 1995 consumers paid more than $1.4 billion for installation and use of six million second phone lines devoted to accessing the Internet or other online services. The study said another eight million second lines were not primarily used for Internet access.\nLocal phone companies, some of which had not yet seen the new study, disputed Selwyn\'s conclusions."To suggest that there is no real problem here is mind-boggling," Bell Atlantic spokesman Harry Mitchell said. As Internet companies add huge numbers of phone lines to meet growing demand, "it does impact the capacity of the public telephone network."  \nAmerica Online, for example, said recently it would double the number of modems it has to connect with subscribers from 200,000 to 400,000 by June.\nBut phone company studies considered only a few pieces of the phone system, focusing on switches between Internet service providers and the rest of the network, Selwyn said. While those few switches might be congested, capacity could be added inexpensively, he said.\nThe study also cited speeches by some phone company executives who have bragged about the additional revenues generated by increased Internet usage.  \n"Sales of secondary lines at Bell Atlantic increased more than 50 percent, fueled by surging demand for Internet and telecommuting applications," company CEO Raymond Smith told Wall Street analysts last March. The revenue generated substantial profit because "we were able to provision new lines and services from idle capacity in an existing plant."\nCompany spokesman Mitchell said charges from second lines "were not designed to subsidize Internet service providers."\nHowever, all sides agree that a technological solution could eliminate most congestion problems by separating calls carrying voice and data.\nSBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, announced last week it would introduce such splitting technology at a cost of less than $100 million.\n"Technological solutions are readily available," Paul Misener, chairman of the Internet coalition\'s steering committee said.\n((--202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'Prospects for comprehensive reform of U.S. banking and financial services laws remain bright despite a far-reaching proposal being considered by the Clinton Administration that has upset some banks.\nMost in government and the industry now agree that the 60-year-old Glass-Steagall Act separating banking from other financial activities like insurance and securities dealing should be scrapped.\nBut there is little consensus about removing the barriers between financial firms and other commercial companies, a position the administration is actively considering for its reform proposal expected in the next two months.\n"The feeling is still very, very good that everyone wants Glass-Steagall reformed," former Congressman and bank lobbyist Larry LaRocco said.\nWith almost two years left for the 105th Congress, legislators should have sufficient time to come to agreement, added LaRocco, managing director of the American Bankers Association\'s securities section.\n"There\'s tremendous momentum building. Maybe it won\'t be in 1997 but certainly within the 105th," he said.\nFederal courts and regulators spurred the momentum last year by lifting many restrictions on banks\' non-banking activities, LaRocco noted.\nAs previously reported, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is weighing the recommendations of a task force headed by Under Secretary John Hawke to remove all barriers between financial and non-financial companies. Under the plan, a company like General Electric Co. or Microsoft Corp. could own or be owned by a financial services company like Citicorp or Aetna.\n"There has been an enormous amount of movement on the whole issue in the last two months," a person familiar with the administration\'s deliberations said.\nAmong various bills in Congress and the administration, the commerce issue "is the last issue that\'s left, which is an indication of how far we\'ve come. For the first time, the omens are good and this is the only hang-up," the person said.\nThe remaining "hang-up" has raised strong opposition from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach along with smaller banks and consumer groups.\n"There is no public support and no economic need for the conglomeration of financial institutions and other businesses," the Iowa Republican said. "The nation needs to be concerned about creating jobs, not simply consolidating ownership."\nIf the administration pushes ahead with the Hawke plan, it would create a "much longer debate and prolong the process," one Leach staffer added. "This is an issue which (Leach) feels has not been fully debated," the staffer said.\nSmall bankers agree. "It\'s a proposal that would essentially change and concentrate not only the financial structure of the United States but the whole economic and financial structure," said Ken Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America.\nSuch concentration would be bad for the economy, Guenther added. "It is based on very debatable assumptions."\nOne bill in Congress includes a possible compromise approach, lobbyists noted. Representative Marge Roukema\'s bill would allow banking, insurance and securities firms to merge and would allow such companies to derive up to 25 percent of their revenues from non-financial activities.\nThe New Jersey Republican, chairwoman of the House Banking Committee\'s Financial Institutions subcommittee, has lined up some big guns behind her bill. The Alliance for Financial Modernisation, a coalition representing most the large trade groups involved in financial services, broadly endorsed the bill.\n'

a(S'With the Clinton administration busily reworking its 1995 proposal overhauling the U.S. financial services sector, one faction in the Treasury Department is recommending a more far reaching plan this time around, people familiar with the matter said.\nUnder Secretary of the Treasury John Hawke, who oversees an administration working group on bank reform, is pressing for a plan allowing commercial companies to own financial companies, they said.  \nThe Hawke plan is said to be in front of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who carries great weight with the President on financial policy issues.\nMost in the administration and on Capital Hill agree that the 60-year-old laws separating banking from other financial activities like insurance and securities dealing should be scrapped.\nBut there is still widespread disagreement about letting outside companies into financial businesses. "There\'s a major war brewing," one lobbyist familiar with the plan said. "People are choosing up sides and getting to the White House."  \nA spokesman for the Treasury did not have an immediate comment.\nTwo years ago, the Clinton plan took a middle path on the issue between House Banking chairman Jim Leach\'s bill and a proposal put forward by Senate Banking Committee chairman Sen. Alfonse D\'Amato.\nLeach remains strongly opposed to allowing non-financial firms into the financial services sector. The Iowa Republican introduced a bill last month that would allow banks, insurance companies and securities firms to affiliate only amongst themselves.  \nA second House bill, backed by Rep. Marge Roukema, would allow a financial services company to derive up to 25 percent of its revenue from non-financial activities.\nSen. D\'Amato, by contrast, favors lifting all limits, allowing a company like General Electric or Ford to own and operate a bank. D\'Amato is expected to reintroduce his bank reform measure in the next few weeks, a spokesman said.\nThe notion of allowing commercial companies into banking alarms consumer advocates and small banks.\nVeteran consumer advocate Ralph Nader wrote a letter to Secretary Rubin last week opposing the Hawke recommendations.\nCommon ownership "would create powerful conglomerates that would dominate the nation\'s economy," Nader warned in the letter obtained by Reuters.\n"The distortion of the allocation of bank credit ultimately would have a substantial adverse effect on competition and the overall productivity of the economy," Nader wrote.\nSmall bankers also oppose the plan, which could lead to further consolidation and concentration in the banking industry, lobbyists said.\n((--202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'Just days after a U.S. graduate student cracked the most powerful computer encryption system allowed out of the country, the Commerce Department announced it would allow three companies to export an even stronger system.\nUntil this year, computer encryption programmes, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key," were classified as munitions and stronger programmes could not be exported.\nBut under a controversial new Clinton administration policy that took effect Jan. 1, companies may recieve permission to export stronger programmes.\n"I\'m happy that we\'ve been able to do this within the first month without rancour or difficulty," Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration William Reinsch said in a telephone interview.\nTo export stronger programmes immediately, companies must agree to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the software keys.\nThe adminstration\'s policy has been widely criticised as not relaxing the export limits enough and some companies feared the requirement for a two-year plan would substantially delay export approvals.\nThe quick approvals should quell some of the criticism and encourage more applicants, Reinsch said.\n"As a result of this, you will have more companies taking it seriously and we will expect more plans over the next couple of months," he said.\nEncryption was once the realm of spies and generals. But with the explosion of online commerce on the Internet, encryption has become a vital tool for protecting everything from a business\' e-mail message to a consumer\'s credit card number sent over the Net.\nThe amount of protection afforded by encryption is largely a function of the length of the software key measured in bits, the smallest unit of computer data.\nCompanies said products with just 40-bit long keys, the old limit, were too easy to crack. The approvals came just days after Ian Goldberg, a graduate student at the University of California, cracked a message encoded with a sofware key 40-bits long.\nThe government did not name the companies on Friday given permission to export stronger, 56-bit programmes, but Glenwood, Maryland-based Trusted Information Systems acknowledged that it was one of the three.\n"Recent attacks on 40-bit encryption have shown that a global move to at least 56-bit (U.S. government standard) security must come soon," Trusted Information Executive Vice President Steven Lipner said.\n'

a(S'An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.\nThe Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the administration\'s approach.\nOn perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.\nAfter indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, "this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful access."\nOn all the controversial areas in the draft, "the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don\'t always coincide," John Dryden, head of the group\'s Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.\nSome countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement\'s efforts to catch criminals and global terrorists, he said.\nThe guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be "no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities."\nInstead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.\n"It\'s not in itself a cryptography policy and it\'s not an attempt to draft a model national law that we\'re encouraging people to adopt," Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in encryption.\nThe guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be "determined by the market in an open and competitive environment."\n"There\'s a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs," Dryden said.\nU.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. "They\'re an important and helpful step forward," Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.\n"They\'re helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this," he added.\nReinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.\nU.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.\n"This is not helpful," said Netscape Communications Corp.\'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.\nThe draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group\'s 29 member countries, including the United States, Japan and Germany.\n'

a(S'An international Internet group released its plan Wednesday to dramatically increase the number of available addresses in cyberspace while quelling disputes over the use of trademarks in those address names.\nThe International Ad Hoc Committee, which includes members of Internet standards-setting bodies and legal and communications experts, proposed seven new "top-level domains," the last block of letters at the end of every Internet address.\nIf the plan is adopted, Net surfers will see addresses ending in "web", "store", "info", "firm", "arts", "rec" and "nom", joining "com", "edu", "gov" and other existing top-level domains.\nEach new domain reflects a particular type or category of Internet site. For example, "rec" would be for sites emphasising recreation and entertainment, while "nom" would be for those desiring individual or personal nomenclature.\nIn drafting the plan, the group received more than 4,000 comments from around the world. The consensus-building approach followed an outcry that arose when a few Internet bodies unveiled a similiar plan last August.\n"We are very pleased with the acceptance and broad consensus that we have achieved in this process," said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chair of the ad hoc committee. "To attain its fullest potential, the Internet requires true self-governance."\nHeath said the plan should be approved by Internet standard setters within a few weeks, allowing new domains to come online about three months later.\nThe plan includes provisions to resolve disputes arising over the use of trademarked names as Internet addresses.\nLast year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the Internet address "candyland.com," which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs.\nBut more complex disputes are arising where both parties may have a legitimate claim to an Internet address.\nUnder the committee plan, anyone applying for an Internet address will have to agree to resolve disputes through online mediation under the rules of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Mediation will be provided by panels composed of international experts on intellectual property, trademarks and the Net. Challenges initiated within 60 days of an address registration would be resolved within 30 days.\nAll challenges and proposed decisions would be made public and time allowed for comment before a final decision was rendered.\nThe plan will not completely eliminate court battles, attorneys said. "It\'s much better than the policies we\'ve seen in the past, but, just by the nature of how valuable these domains have become, litigation will continue," said Paul Terry, Internet law specialist at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts.\nThe plan also calls for establishing up to 28 competing registration firms to dole out the new addresses. The firms will operate under the auspices of a Council of Registrars, to be established as a non-profit association in Switzerland.\nCurrently, one firm, Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions Inc., hands out addresses in the most popular domains, charging $100 for a two-year registration.\nNetwork Solutions, which registers over 80,000 new Internet addresses a month, had no comment on the plan, but a spokesman raised doubts about its viability. "We\'re concerned with the stability and integrity of the registration process," spokesman Christopher Clough said.\nThe complete proposal is posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.iahc.org/draft-iahc-recommend-00.html.\n'

a(S'The various sectors of the U.S. financial services industry will spar over bank reform proposals at a hearing on Tuesday before the House Banking Committee\'s subcommittee on financial institutions.\nWith most in Congress and industry ready to scrap the Depression-era laws separating banking from other financial services, one of the hottest topics is likely to be whether even broader reform is required.\nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin is considering a proposal to allow combinations between commercial and financial firms.  \nWhile savings institutions and insurance companies can already own or be owned by non-financial companies, banks operate under much tighter restrictions.\nA Treasury Department task force recommended that the administration\'s bank reform proposal, expected in about a month, allow mixing of commerce and banking, permitting Ford Motor Co or Microsoft to own Citicorp or BankAmerica.\nRubin told a group of bankers at a private meeting last week that the administration has not yet made a decision on the contentious issue, people familiar with the meeting said.  \nThe high-level private-sector group, known as the Federal Reserve\'s Federal Advisory Council, also met with House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach last week.\nLeach, who strongly opposes mixing commerce and banking, told the group of CEOs that their banks could be taken over by larger capitalized companies.\n"They\'ll be at the working end of the food chain," Leach reportedly told the bankers according to one person familiar with the meeting. Spokesman for Leach and Rubin declined to comment on the meetings.  \nAt Tuesday\'s hearing, insurance and savings groups will oppose restrictions on commercial and financial combinations. The mutual fund industry also opposes restrictions.\nSmall banks, represented by the Independent Bankers Association of America, will take the opposite position, in favor of imposing legal barriers.\nFederal Reserve officials, along with some consumer, agricultural and union groups favor restrictions but will not be heard from on Tuesday. The Fed will testify on Thursday along with other government agencies, while consumer gropups will testify at a Feb 25 hearing.  \nThe AFL-CIO recently sent a letter to the Clinton administration charging that allowing unlimited mergers would drag the U.S. economy back into the 19th century with a "reinstatement of trusts and monopolies," a person who read the letter said.\nLeading Democrats, including ranking minority members of House and Senate banking panels Rep Henry Gonzalez and Sen Paul Sarbanes, also favor restrictions.\nNot all Republicans agree with Leach and the Democrats. Rep. Marge Roukema, chairwoman of the financial institutions subcommittee, has introduced a bill that would allow financial companies to do 25 percent of their business in non-financial markets.\nAnd in the Senate, Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D\'Amato has opposed restrictions and plans to introduce his own bank reform measure soon.\nRep Gonzalez is likely to raise questions about the possible risks to federal deposit insurance funds, some lobbyists said. Gonzalez has said conglomerate combinations should have limited access to deposit insurance.\n((--202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'The debate over reforming America\'s financial services sector, a top priority for Congress and the Clinton administration, began in earnest Tuesday.\nAs major industry representatives sat down at a House Banking subcommitee hearing on two pending reform bills, word came that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D\'Amato, R.-N.Y., had introduced his own version of comprehensive reform.\nThe bills introduced so far, as well as an administration proposal expected late next month, begin with the same premise: the time is right to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act enacted during the Depression to separate banking from other financial activities like securities underwriting and insurance.\nMost in Congress agree. And, for the first time, most financial service company seem to agree as well.\nAt the hearing of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, representatives of banking, insurance, securities and mutual funds all agreed Congress should allow a single entity to span all financial services businesses.\nBut, as subcommittee Chairwoman Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, observed, "The devil is in the details."\nThose who had opposed tearing down Glass-Steagall, mainly insurance and securities companies, have seen federal courts and regulators slowly roll back the law -- but only for banks.\nLast March, the Supreme Court freed banks from many state insurance restrictions.\nThe Federal Reserve also decided to allow banks to derive up to 25 percent of a subsidiary\'s revenue from securities activity, an increase from the previous limit of 10 percent. In November, the comptroller of the currency said he would start allowing national banks to enter a host of non-banking businesses.\nBanks got substantial new authority, but others got nothing.\n"For too long, important policy issues have been addressed by regulatory agencies or the courts rather than by Congress," Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Vice President Roy Albertalli testified at the hearing. Albertalli spoke on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurance, which had opposed mixing banks and insurance.\nAll the proposals before Congress would level the playing field to some degree and recognise the changes that have shaken modern finance.\n"This banking reform legislation will reform the current patchwork of laws and allow the market to operate freely within the financial services industry," D\'Amato said as he introduced his bill.\nWhile a broad consensus has been achieved, several important issues remain to be addressed. Perhaps the most controversial is the extent to which non-financial companies should be allowed to own or be owned by financial companies.\nUnder existing law, mutual funds, insurance companies and savings and loans can combine with so-called commercial firms while banks cannot.\nSmaller banks and consumer groups staunchly oppose mixing the two, which would be permitted under the D\'Amato bill, limited under the Roukema bill and forbidden under a bill introduced by House Banking Chairman Jim Leach, R.-Iowa.\nJoseph Bracewell of the Indepedent Bankers Association of America laid out the opposition. Citing former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Bracewell said such mergers could "distort lending decisions, be anticompetitive and threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system.\nBanks said they could live with Roukema\'s compromise approach, but were undecided about the D\'Amato plan. Others heartily endorsed the unlimited approach.\nMutual funds have been "knee-deep in affiliations" and "they\'ve never proved a problem in 57 years," said Matt Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute.\nDifferences also remain regarding regulation of new, diversified financial services companies, although most favoured an approach having various, specialised agencies regulate the relevent portion of each firm\'s activities.\n'

a(S'Several U.S. legislators are planning to introduce measures soon to relax export restrictions on encryption technology, an increasingly essential part of global communications and online commerce.\nLast year, the Clinton administration relaxed some of the Cold War era export limits on the technology, specialized computer programs that scramble data and render it unreadable without a password or software "key."\nBut computer companies said the administration did not go far enough, locking them out of the growing global market.  \nRep. Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, plans to reintroduce a bill on Wednesday that would go well beyond the Clinton administration\'s approach, staff people in his office said.\nGoodlatte\'s bill would allow computer companies like Netscape Communications Corp or Microsoft Corp to export products with powerful encryption features if foreign competitors were selling similiar technology.\nIn the Senate, Montana Republican Sen Conrad Burns is also planning to reintroduce his encryption bill from last year.  \nAt an informal gathering of the Congressional Internet Caucus Tuesday night, Burns said he expected to put forth the bill, known by the acronym PRO-CODE, in late February.\nAt one time, the Senator had said the 1997 bill would be identical to last year\'s bill which did not get a vote in the Commerce Committee.  But staffers said the Senator is still tweaking the bill to draw more supporters.\n"It\'s about ready to go," Burns said Tuesday night.\nGoodlatte\'s bill, under the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee, had already garnered 54 co-sponsors by Tuesday night.  \nStaff said the bill almost had the backing of a majority of the members of the Judiciary Committee.\nOthers are also considering introducing bills, some seeking a middle approach between the administration and the Burns and Goodlatte bills, which would remove nearly all export restrictions.\nSen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and co-chair of the Internet Caucus, may have a bill and Rep Rick White, Pennsylvania Republican and also co-chair, is considering weighing in, staff people said.\nSome lobbyists involved in the debate said that the administration was considering introducing its own legislation.  But they were unsure about the contents of the legislation, since the administration implemented its new policy by a Presidential executive order in November.\nAdministration officials were not immediately available for comment.\n((--202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'A scuffle breaking out between a top U.S. bank regulator and the state of Rhode Island could foreshadow an increasing number of disputes as more national banks begin selling insurance products, market participants said.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said last month it is considering overriding a new Rhode Island insurance law that imposes different requirements on banks selling insurance than those imposed on on insurance agents.  \nWhile national banks have long had the legal right to sell insurance in small towns, state insurance regulators often imposed onerous rules on the banks.\nBut last year, the Supreme Court rejected discriminatory state insurance laws and ruled that states cannot "significantly interfere" with national banks conducting permissible activities.\nBanks said that states are now trying to evade the court\'s ruling. They charged that an insurance agents trade group is pushing states to adopt laws like the Rhode Island measure.  \n"The Rhode Island statute is their first successful effort to pass such restrictive legislation," James McIntyre, counsel to Association of Banks-in-Insurance, said in a letter this week to the OCC.\n"Many other states are considering similiar legislation or regulations at this time. Guidance from the OCC is urgently needed if we are to avoid wasteful legislation and avoid pointless litigation," McIntyre added.\nMajor states such as Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois are expected to consider similiar legislation, bankers said.  \nThe Independent Insurance Agents of America fired back in their own letter to the Comptroller\'s office. Preempting the Rhode Island law would be "wholly inappropriate" because the law does not significantly interfere with a national bank\'s ability to sell insurance, the group said.\nThe agents added that an override would be premature. Although the law was enacted in August, the state has not finished writing the implementing regulations.\nBanks said the law on its face is more burdensome to banks than to others selling insurance.  \nFor example, bank personnel involved in teller activities or making loans would be restricted from selling insurance, forcing banks to have two different sales forces, McIntyre said.\nThe Comptroller\'s Office is reviewing the comments it received and will issue an opinion, but has not set a deadline for making a decision, a spokesman said.\n'

a(S'Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday urged Congress to modernise U.S. financial laws but warned that some government oversight must be maintained to avert financial catastrophes.\nA top priority of regulators, Greenspan said after a speech at a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta conference here, is to prevent "systemic risk," where a problem in one firm or market spreads through the financial system and ultimately undermines the entire economy.\nIf a bankruptcy or market crash cannot be contained, it could behave like a chain reaction spreading through all markets, he warned.\nThe failure of Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s, for example, raised fears that its collapse would cause a cascade of failures among large Wall Street firms and commercial banks that had lent funds to Drexel. But the firm was liquidated in an orderly fashion and losses did not spread.\nUsing its existing authority to oversee banks and provide loans, the Federal Reserve has been able to contain previous crises, Greenspan said. "There have been occasions when we have been on the edge of a significant breakout," he said, but declined to name the institutions involved.\nThe Fed\'s actions and other rules governing financial firms "turned out to be adequate to stem the atomic erosion," he said, returning to the nuclear analogy.\n"Regulation, by its very nature, becomes increasingly obsolete," Greenspan said. "Regulation imposed in an earlier period would be wholly or partly inappropriate for something that evolves at a later date."\nCongress is currently considering several bills to reform laws governing banks, which would affect the Fed, which is one of the nation\'s primary bank regulators. Legislators have also introduced a measure to modernise rules on derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of something else such as a commodity, stock or currency price.\n"It is important for Congress to periodically review" such laws, Greenspan said. "Regulators are required to do that."\nFor example, in a recent review of Regulation Y, governing non-bank interests of bank holding companies, the Fed found that "some of that stuff is just unbelievable because the markets have changed so much," the Fed chairman said, without elaborating.\nIf Congress alters the Fed\'s responsibilities, it should not strip the central bank of its ability to contain systemic risk, Greenspan argued. "Having seen the inner workings of these things, a lot of the things we do actually are quite effective," he said.\n"I would be very chagrined to see some of these powers disappear ... I say that from someone who believes the less you interfere in the market, the better."\nUnder one proposal before Congress, the Federal Reserve would remain a primary regulator of financial institutions such as banks. But under other proposals, that authority could be divided among many regulators or entrusted to a new committee of federal regulators.\nThe Fed offered to provide loans following the stock market crash of 1987, for example, preventing a liquidity crisis that could have caused wider problems for the economy.\nGreenspan also appeared to side with the Treasury Department in its long-running dispute with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the appropriate scope of U.S. laws governing futures trading.\nUnder a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, trading of foreign currency and certain other instruments is exempt from CFTC oversight. But federal courts have made contradictory rulings about the scope of the amendment, especially as it relates to derivatives, and the Supreme Court is expected to deliver a ruling on the issue soon.\nGreenspan said Congress did not need to impose new regulations on trading of derivatives over-the-counter by sophisticated institutional investors. "There appears to be no need," he said. Regulation under the commodity act "seems an inappropriate framework," he added.\nEven trading by less-sophisticated retail investors "is more appropriately regulated" by bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, not the CFTC, he said.\nGreenspan\'s comments were significant and could affect lawmakers\' decisions when they consider related legislation, an Association executive said.\n"If you\'re going to vote on these issues and you\'ve been kind of on the fence with respect to pro-market or expansion of CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) power, etcetera, I have to believe that his comments influence that person who\'s on the fence," said John Frawley, chairman of the Managed Futures Association.\n"So if you\'re looking for a Good Housekeeping seal of approval, he just sort of stamped it on those who are looking for such a thing," Frawley told reporters at a briefing.\n'

a(S'The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether a federal regulator had properly allowed credit unions to expand their membership over the past 15 years, settling a long-running legal dispute between the cooperative non-profits and banks.\nCredit unions praised the court\'s action to reconsider an Appellate court decision last July in favour of the banks. But bank representatives said the court was only delaying the inevitable.\nThe 1934 Federal Credit Union Act creating credit unions "was not meant to delineate and protect bank markets at the expense of the consumer," said Marc Schaefer, president of AT&amp;T Family Federal Credit Union, the credit union being sued by banks in the case.\n"Consumers everywhere will be the winners when banks compete in the marketplace instead of the courts and on Capitol Hill," Schaeffer added.\nAmerican Bankers Association executive vice president Donald Ogilvie countered that "the facts and law weigh overwhelmingly in our favour."\n"We are disappointed at the prospect of delay in the enfocement of a law we believe is quite clear," he said.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. A decision is likely early next year.\nThe case affects about 3,600 federal credit unions serving 32 million customers, Justice Department lawyer Walter Dellinger said.\nThe appeals court ruling in favour of the banks "threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons," Dellinger said.\nUntil 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, such as people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. Owned by their members, non-profit credit unions paid no federal taxes and were able to offer bank-like services often at lower prices than banks.\nBut in 1982, concerned about a lack of diversification, the National Credit Union Administration decided to allow credit unions to accept members from multiple distinct groups.\nAs many previously tiny credit unions diversified and grew substantially larger, banks complained of unfair competition. In 1990, they sued AT&amp;T Family Federal, a North Carolina union that had grown to encompass over 150 different groups.\nAfter the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 1982 policy change last July, a lower court imposed strict membership limits on multi-group credit unions.\nThose limits have since been put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. But if the banks win, their next move could be to ask the courts to force multi-group credit unions to throw out members from all but one group.\nCredit unions said they will ask Congress to amend the law if they lose in the Supreme Court.\n"Congress never intended the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act to limit credit union growth or to protect banks from competition," said Daniel Mica, president of Credit Union National Association, a leading trade group. "If the court does not see it this way, we think Congress will recognise consumers\' need for credit unions."\n((202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the nation\'s primary regulators of derivatives, has no authority over most foreign currency transactions, the Supreme Court said Tuesday.\nIn a unanimous decision, the court ruled that a 1974 law exempting some transactions in foreign currency from CFTC oversight also exempted some foreign exchange derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of currencies like the dollar or Japanese yen.\nThe CFTC regulates trading of derivatives such as futures and options on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity. By law, such trading must occur on a recogized exchange, such as the Chicago Board of Trade or the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nBut when Congress created the commission in 1974, it added an amendment permitting off-exchange trading in foreign currency and a few other items without CFTC regulation. The amendment was requested by the Treasury Department, which believed that the developing market in foreign currency among large banks and securities firms would be overregulated by CFTC oversight.\nThe CFTC stayed away from the inter-bank foreign exchange market, which has grown to $40 billion a day in total trading. The commission did, however, prosecute small-scale fraudulent foreign exchange investment peddlers, often called "bucket shops."\nBut when the CFTC pursued William Dunn, whose $180 million foreign currency fund lost $95 million in 1993, Dunn argued that the 1974 Treasury amendment should also apply to his trading of foreign exchange options.\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed with the bulk of Dunn\'s argument.\n"We think it plain that foreign currency options are \'transactions in foreign currency\' within the plain meaning of the statute," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. "We are not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by the CFTC in support of a narrower reading."\nThat pleased banks and Wall Street trade groups, which had sided with Dunn. They argued that subjecting their off-exchange foreign exchange trading to CFTC oversight would be too costly, forcing them to shut down U.S. operations and move overseas.\n"We\'re obviously delighted at the result," said Ken Raisler, an attorney for several of the trade groups.\n"It supports our view that the amendment should be read broadly," Raisler, a former general counsel of the CFTC added.\nDunn\'s lawyer and the banks suggested that any wrongdoing in the foreign exchange area could be dealt with under existing law by other federal agencies, but the Supreme Court did not address the issue. Most off-exchange derivatives trading is not directly regulated, although most participants in such markets are overseen by bank, securities and insurance regulators.\nThe CFTC still has jurisdiction over foreign currency derivatives traded on an exchange, which include futures contracts. But that market is dwarfed by the over-the-counter market among banks and similiar institutions.\nIn a lower court case last year, the CFTC argued unsuccessfully that a fraudulent "bucket shop" constituted an exchange.\nOn Tuesday, the commission maintained that the Supreme Court had decided only the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment covered options trading.\n"While we are disappointed in the outcome of the case, we note that the Supreme Court\'s opinion was limited to the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment treats futures and options the same," CFTC general counsel Dan Waldman said. "The court\'s decision does not affect the commission\'s ongoing efforts to police fraud against the public in foreign currency trading."\nCongress is already discussing amending the 1974 Treasury amendment. The Supreme Court\'s decision "underlines the need for Congress to make decisions about what financial products should or should not be subject to the CFTC\'s jurisdiction," said Andy Fisher, spokesman for the Senate Agriculture Committee.\nSens. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, introduced a Senate bill to overhaul futures regulation. "It makes the case to proceed with that bill as quickly as we can," Fisher said.\nThe court invited congressional action. Recognising an "important public policy dispute" underlying the case, the court suggested "these arguments are addressed to the Congress, not the courts."\n'

a(S'Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration\'s export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.\nEncryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key," were once the realm of spies and generals.\nBut with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business\'s e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer\'s credit card number if it is transmitted online.\nSenators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.\nThe bills "roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers," Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.\n"Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations," said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican , also a co-sponsor.\nThe bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.\nUnder the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software "key" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.\nIf the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.\nThe legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.\nThe Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.\n"We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns\' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety," Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. "We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data."\nComputer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.\n"Both bills promote the freedom of this nation\'s fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand," said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.\'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.\n"This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.\nBerman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be "my lock, my key."\n'

a(S'It may be only the second qualifier on the long road leading to the 1998 World Cup but the Czech Republic and Spain are approaching Wednesday night\'s European group six match as though it were a battle for the final.\nFor the Czechs it will be the first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Spain are expected to give Real Madrid\'s teenage striker Raul Gonzalez his first cap in the hope that he will give them badly-needed scoring power.\nBoth sides opened their campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0.\nBut Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither the Czechs nor Spain can afford to give ground in Prague.\n"(The Spanish) are explosive and technically very sound. This game\'s made all the more important because a loss will make it a difficult trip for either side," Czech midfielder Karel Poborsky of English premier league Manchester United said.\nVictory alone will satisfy Spain\'s veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. "I would not be happy with a draw, we want three points," he said.\nCzech coach Dusan Uhrin has named 16 of the 19-strong squad which caused a surprise by reaching the final of June\'s European championship in which they lost to Germany.\nThey include in-form midfielder Patrik Berger, who scored six goals in 10 days for English premier league Liverpool last month.\n"Spain is obviously a strong team but we showed in London that we can play anybody," Berger said.\nWhile the Czechs are looking to build on recent success, Spain are rebuilding and plugging holes where necessary.\nRaul, 19, who scored twice against the Czechs in the quarter-finals of last season\'s European under-21 competition, is Real Madrid\'s top scorer even after being moved into a supporting role by new coach Fabio Capello.\n"There are some players absent...It\'s the right moment to pick Raul," Spain manager Javier Clemente said.\nClemente had been strongly criticised for sticking by veteran forward Julio Salinas instead of choosing Raul.\nNeither Salinas nor injured striker Kiko Narvaez are on the trip but Kiko\'s Atletico Madrid team mate Jose Luis Caminero is fit and is expected to be given the role of playmaker in the starting line-up.\nWith Spain likely to face problems in the air, tall defender Roberto Rios and striker Ismael Urzaiz have been called into the squad for the first time.\nOf the seven players chosen from the multi-billion peseta Barcelona line-up, midfielder Guillermo Amor, defender Abelardo Fernandez and striker Juan Pizzi have not played regularly this season under new coach Bobby Robson, a former England manager.\nBy contrast utility man Luis Enrique Martinez has blossomed since moving to Barcelona from Real Madrid.  \nTeams (from):\nCzech Republic - Petr Kouba, Pavel Srnicek; Miroslav Kadlec, Lubos Kubik, Tomas Repka, Michal Hornak, Jan Suchoparek; Radoslav Latal, Jiri Nemec, Karel Poborsky, Pavel Nedved, Patrik Berger, Radek Bejbl, Pavel Novotny, Martin Frydek, Richard Dostalek; Pavel Kuka, Vladimir Smicer, Radovan Hromadko.\nSpain - Andoni Zubizarreta, Santiago Canizares; Roberto Rios, Alberto Belsue, Rafael Alkorta, Fernando Hierro, Miguel Angel Nadal, Agustin Aranzabal, Sergi Barjuan, Abelardo Fernandez; Guillermo Amor, Josep Guardiola, Luis Enrique Martinez, Julen Guerrero, Jose Luis Caminero, Juan Pizzi, Raul Gonzalez, Alfonso Perez, Ismael Urzaiz.\n'

Ljubljana was the one gray cloud, posting slight losses.\nThe Central European Share Index (CESI) which reflects the price movements of 50 selected Czech, Polish and Hungarian shares, firmed 66.11 points.\nPRAGUE\nCzech share prices were mostly steady on the Prague Stock Exchange throughout the week, with little movement expected soon as the holiday season slowly winds up.\nThe PX50 index edged up 3.6 points from Monday to close at 568.6 on Thursday.\nLeading trading were SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka, though SPT\'s movements were largely characterised as "accounting procedures" that saw the issue gain as much as 102 crowns one session, only to lose the same amount the following day.\n"The final price (of SPT) was not the real market price, but because average prices are not used for the close, it gives an artificial final number," said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. SPT closed on Thursday at 3,340 crowns.\nDealers have long-complained that some market participants consistently manipulate prices on the bourse, a fact that to cloud foreign investor perceptions of the Czech market.\nWARSAW\nPolish shares on Thursday rose for the sixth consecutive session but analysts said stronger selling after price-fixing showed the market was losing steam and made it unclear if the growth trend would continue.\n"It seems we now have a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers," said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski SA brokerage.\nBut some analysts said a real growth trend had already begun, sparked by firms releasing better July earnings at the start of the week.

But his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes kept Fetterlein, ranked 129th in the world, permanently on the back foot.\n"I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow," said Becker who needed just over an hour to defeat his opponent.\nThe world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the ligament he tore in a third round match at Wimbledon forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.\nHis return to form may be just enough to earn the 28-year-old a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. Becker currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hanover.\nMartin, ranked 11th in the world, also had little trouble disposing of Caratti, needing just 49 minutes for his straight sets win.\nFor Ulihrach, meeting a Davis Cup team mate for the second consecutive day proved too much, as he put up little resistance to Novak.\nThe previous day Ulihrach beat Daniel Vacek, ranked one spot below him at 36th, but could not recapture the service return which propelled him into the second round against Novak, ranked 40th.\n'

a(S'Boris Becker withdrew from the Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury, while top seed Goran Ivanisevic crashed out to Czech Petr Korda 7-6 6-2.\nBecker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist at the Wimbledon championships this year, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm.\n"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening," ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said.\nOn Wednesday Becker had held his wrist several times during his 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark\'s Frederik Fetterlein.\nThe world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.\nBecker\'s absence has set back his bid for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot.\nIvanisevic, who has already qualified for the tour finale, lives and dies by the serve. \nBut he was outgunned by Korda who served 10 aces and only one double fault, while Ivanisevic managed only nine aces along with five double faults.\n"He surprised me the way he played, he served well and returned very well. I double-faulted at 5-5 in the tie break which hurt," said Ivanisevic.\n"I didn\'t return well, I didn\'t take any chances on his second serve. I didn\'t know whether to stay back or come in and when you\'re not sure what to do then it\'s no good."\nSecond seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink.\nFerreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink\'s backhand let him down on three successive occasions.\n'

a(S'Third seed Boris Becker on Thursday withdrew from the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring injury to his right wrist.\nBecker, who tore a ligament in the wrist during a third round match at this year\'s Wimbledon, trained on Thursday morning, but afterward complained of pain in his wrist.\nHe later told ATP officials that he would not play his second round match against Czech Martin Damm later on Thursday.\n"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening," ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw told Reuters. He did not elaborate.\nOn Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to an easy 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark\'s Frederik Fetterlein.\nDuring the match he held his wrist several times, and appeared to be favouring it again at practice on Thursday morning. Becker immediately left the training court for his hotel. He was not available for comment\n"I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow," Becker said after the match on Wednesday.\nThe world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the wrist forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.\nBecker\'s withdrawal puts a serious dent in the 28 year old\'s plans to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hannover.\nIt also comes as a blow to tournament organisers. Though he was only ranked third in the tournament behind top seed Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most of the tickets sold were by fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the German.\nBarely 1,000 fans came out to watch Ivanisevic\'s first round match against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. In contrast, a tournament record crowd of some 10,000 watched Becker defeat the Fetterlien, ranked 156 in the world.\n'

I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn\'t really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office.\n"I\'m disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I\'ve played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris."\nPrinosil said: "I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me."\nDamm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week\'s march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played.\nVictimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich.\nFor Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches.\nThe former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings.\n"I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I\'ve never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level," said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.\n'

I don\'t think I have ever played this well," said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.\nKorda said: "I was a little drained from yesterday\'s match and he hit the ball well.

a(S'The Prague Stock Exchange suffered one of its biggest one-day falls ever on Friday, as waning foreign interest due to a lack of market transparency continues to run roughshod over the beleaguered bourse.\nFour of the PSE\'s five largest issues fell sharply in active trading, pulling the Reuters RPIX index down nearly three percent to 1,052.\nLong-criticised for its lack of transparency and regulation, analysts say Friday\'s loss was yet another sign that investors, especially foreigners, are pulling out of the market having grown tired of failed promises of reform.\n"There\'s just a total lack of interest in this market," said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.\n"Fundamentally, companies look pretty cheap, but the lack of foreign interest and Czechs fearing the possibility of a devaluation and looking abroad (mean) you don\'t have tha much buying interest."\nUnder the Czech Republic\'s Securities Act, which was devised to handle the logistics of the government\'s massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.\nSince the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process.\nThe problems have restrained the PSE which sees on average $4-$6 million of stock changing hands each day, compared with $15 million turnover in Warsaw, where the market has a capitalisation of just $3 billion.\n"Unambiguously, a notable portion of foreign investors are not satisified with the current state of the Czech capital market," said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.\nIn April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.\nThe PSE has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, but some analysts say that the process is taking too long.\nIn mid-September, the Prague Stock Exchange pledged to improve the state of the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog.\nBut many analysts were disappointed by the lack of strong enforcement requirements, as market supervision is still kept in the hands of a small, under-resourced Finance Ministry department.\nAnd some question whether there is even the political will here to change the market, or if a few regulations will be enough to change the attitude of many market participants.\n"The problem isn\'t only with market regulations. I don\'t feel the political will which can bring change and prevent frauds.," Markus Winkler, manager of the Discover Europe Investment Fund was quoted in the dsaily Mlada Fronta Dnes as saying on Friday.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n'

a(S'The Prague Stock Exchange suffered one of its biggest one-day falls on Friday as foreign interest waned because of a lack of market transparency.\nFour of the PSE\'s five largest issues fell sharply in active trading, pulling the Reuters RPIX index down nearly three percent to 1,052.\nLong-criticised for its lack of transparency and regulation, analysts say Friday\'s loss was yet another sign that investors, especially foreigners, are pulling out of the market having grown tired of failed promises of reform.\n"There\'s just a total lack of interest in this market," said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.\n"Fundamentally, companies look pretty cheap, but the lack of foreign interest and Czechs fearing the possibility of a devaluation and looking abroad (mean) you don\'t have that much buying interest."\nUnder the Czech Republic\'s Securities Act, which was devised to handle the logistics of the government\'s massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.\nSince the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process.\nThe problems have restrained the PSE which sees on average $4-$6 million of stock changing hands each day, compared with $15 million turnover in Warsaw, where the market has a capitalisation of just $3 billion.\n"Unambiguously, a notable portion of foreign investors are not satisified with the current state of the Czech capital market," said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.\nIn April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.\nThe PSE has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, but some analysts say that the process is taking too long.\nIn mid-September, the Prague Stock Exchange pledged to improve the state of the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog.\nBut many analysts were disappointed by the lack of strong enforcement requirements, as market supervision is still kept in the hands of a small, under-resourced Finance Ministry department.\nAnd some question whether there is even the political will here to change the market, or if a few regulations will be enough to change the attitude of many market participants.\n"The problem isn\'t only with market regulations. I don\'t feel the political will which can bring change and prevent frauds.," Markus Winkler, manager of the Discover Europe Investment Fund was quoted in the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes as saying on Friday.\n'

a(S'Czech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday said its nine-month gross profit hit 6.0 billion crowns, in line with analysts predictions and likely to have little effect on the firm\'s share price.\nSPT said in a statement that revenues for the first three quarters totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns in total revenues for 1995.\nSPT\'s 1995 full year gross profit was 7.0 billion crowns. All figures are calculated according to International Accounting Standards (IAS).\nSPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 on the Prague Stock Exchange on Thursday, though dealers said the results came out after trading ended for the day.\n"The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth," said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance.\nThe statement added the number of lines installed accelerated in the third quarter, putting the year-to-date figure at 272,000 lines and the overall installed base at 2.67 million lines.\n"The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines," the statement said.\nSPT, of which a Dutch-Swiss consortium comprised of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom bought a 27 percent stake last summer, is aiming to increase the network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998.\nThe statement said that investment expenditures for the first nine months totalled more than 20 billion crowns, "more than the full year 1995 capital expenditure.\n"If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned," said one local telecom analyst.\nAnalysts said that the figures would probably not have an immediate effect on SPT\'s share price, since the entire Czech capital market is in a downturn as investors avoid a market they characterise as plagued with a lack of transparency.\nCompany officials have been adamant that SPT would not pay a dividend before 1998, as profits would still have to be ploughed back into the network\'s modernisation.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n'

a(S'Czech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday reported a nine-month gross profit of 6.0 billion crowns, in line with forecasts, and said outlays for investment rose significantly in the period.\n"The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth," said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance.\nThe company\'s gross profit for all of 1995 was 7.0 billion crowns. SPT used International Accounting Standards in calculating its profit.\nIn a statement, the company said revenues  totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns for 1995.\nSPT said outlays for investment in the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion crowns or more than the total for 1995.\nA Dutch-Swiss consortium of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, which bought a 27 percent stake in SPT from the government last summer, has effective day-to-day control of the firm. The consortium paid $1.32 billion for its stake.\nSPT said it installed more telephone lines in the Czech Republic in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to 272,000 lines. SPT now has a total of 2.67 million lines.\n"The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines," the statement said. The company is aiming to increase its network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998.\nSPT is the only telephone line operator in the country. There are also two GSM mobile phone operators, but they do not install hard lines.\n"If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned," said one local telecom analyst.\nSPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 in after-bourse trading in Prague.\nThe company didn\'t comment on its dividend policy.

a(S'A Czech central bank scheme to buy doubtful debts of smaller banks and restore stability to the banking sector has attracted interest from about 10 banks, the Czech news agency reported on Wednesday.\nCTK, quoting central bank spokesman Martin Svehla, said that of the 13 banks allowed to participate in the plan, the number that had expressed an interest in joining "is nearing 10".\nCentral bank officials were not immediately available for comment.\nThe Czech National Bank (CNB) outlined the programme in mid-October followed the failure of Kreditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the politicisation of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks.\nUnder the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed. CNB officials said the programme was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank.\nThe plan will be open to all small private banks with total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million) and total assets of not more than 30 billion crowns.\nThe state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks\' doubtful assets at face value.\nThe banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime.\nBanks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio.\nBanks also must maintain cost controls, profitability and liquidity as well as agreeing to frequent reviews by the central bank.\nThe maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank\'s paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated.\nThe programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal which banks elected to participate.\nBanks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka, Evrobanka, Prvni Mestska Banka, COOP Banka, Pragobanka, Plzenska Banka, Foresbank, Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka, Universal Banka, Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana.\nMoney for the scheme is to come primarily from state- controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme.\nAny losses from the programme are to be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n'

a(S'Investors, fed up with a lack of transparency and the poor performance of the Czech equity market, are turning to the country\'s less opaque debt market, buoyed by favourable interest rates and economic data.\nThe Prague bourse has been caught in a downward spiral -- the official PX50 index has lost almost 18 percent in the past two months -- that analysts say won\'t end before the New Year.\nBut while bears maul the equities market, they say bulls are quietly finding greener pastures in Czech debt.\n"The bond market is pretty bullish and the outlook is good. Rates have been tending down and people are positive especially in the longer maturities which are looking more attractive," said Michael Gartner, a debt analyst at ING Capital Markets.\nEstimated daily bond turnover has grown to 900 million to one billion crowns, equal to turnover on the Prague stock exchange, from 500 million a year ago.\n"The bond market is becoming even more important for foreign investors because they can get reasonable prices," said Alojz Lacko, a bond trader at Patria Finance.\nReasonable prices are something investors, foreign and domestic, have long complained they cannot find on the equities market where insufficient legislation has pushed an estimated 70 percent of trading into murky off-market dealing, and trampled minority shareholder rights.\nMany strategic and speculative investors have taken advantage of the opaque system to buy up large stakes in firms without prices or counter-parties being made public until long after the deal has been made.\nBourse and Finance Ministry officials have stepped up their campaign in recent months to assure investors tighter, more stringent rules for trading will be introduced. But analysts say the moves appear to be too little, too late for investors who are turning away from Czech equities.\n"Investors are really put off by the (trading) practices here and frankly, it will be hard to lure some back. But we don\'t have these problems in the debt market, and a lot are turning their attentions there," said one local trader.\nING\'s Gartner said investor motivation for entering the debt market is in many ways different from equity investments. Investor fears of having the carpet pulled out from under them by an off-market takeover deal are non-existent.\n"The bond market is completely transparent because prices are transparent. It\'s a good market: it works, it\'s liquid, foreign investors, domestic investors, pension funds, investment funds all participate on an even field," he said.\nA recent spate of positive economic indicators has further buoyed the market.\nInflation, one of the lowest in the region, eased further in October with the year-on-year rate standing at 8.7 percent.\nThe central bank\'s war on a burgeoning money supply has also borne fruit recently, with the expansion of the key M2 year-on-year rate falling to 13.2 percent at the end of August, just below its 14-17 percent target.\nAlthough investor sentiment has traditionally been bearish on East European bonds because of currency risks, high taxation and political and economic instability, analysts say these factors are less significant in the Czech Republic.\nWhile rates may be higher in neghbouring Poland and Hungary, the markets are very illiquid, especially in local currency corporate issues.\nBut with the strength and stability of the crown the Czech market is attractive because an investor can add a play on the local currency, and have little fear of currency risk since it is tied closely to the mark.\nTraders say the government has also helped by easing currency exchange laws to help foreign investors repatriate their holdings. Foreigners may repatriate interest income on bonds as well as income from selling or redeeming them.\n-- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n'

a(S'Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nEarly results showed candidates of Klaus\'s Civic Democratic Party (ODS) ahead in the few constituencies declared so far but without the majority of the vote needed to win outright, meaning they will face the runner-up in a second round.\nForeign Minister Josef Zieleniec, an ODS vice chairman, welcomed the results but warned supporters against overconfidence. "I\'m very happy that several of our candidates have moved into the next round," he told reporters.\nBut he added: "I warn you, add up all the votes for all of the candidates and think how they will go in the second round. The situation is not as rosy as it may appear from the numbers of ODS candidates that are moving into the next round."\nWith three of the 81 constitunecies officially declared, the striking statistic was the turnout figure which ranged from 26.36 percent in the northern mining town of Most to 29.78 in one constituency in the industrial city of Ostrava.\nOne official of the Central Electoral Commission, Ales Kaspar, forecast that turnout nationwide would be by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. "According to optimistic expectations, the turnout could be between 30 and 40 percent," he told Reuters.\nThis suggested the real winners might not be ODS or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate polls and told Czechs to follow suit.\nOpposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs\' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.\n"I would like to remind all voters who criticise our country that by not voting they do not have the right to criticise the government. They have only the right to criticise themselves," said Zeman, who is speaker of the lower house.\nBut he added: "I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates," he said.\nShare dealers welcomed signs that ODS, which has led free-market reform in recent years, would do well.\n"The early results appear pleasantly good for ODS. To me, if these continue, it could be a good result for the market," said Jan Sykora of Prgaue brokerage Wood and Co.\nPundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus\'s conservative coalition of its majority last June.\nBut the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.\nSladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. "They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate," he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it "would be lazy, useless and expensive".\nOne complaint among voters was that many of the Senate candidates were unknown as government and opposition leaders all sit in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Few Czechs have much idea of what the Senate will do.\nConventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition\'s majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.\nBut Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI), said these theories may not be valid.\nODS is better at mobilising its supporters than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.\n"If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country," he said.\n-- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n'

a(S'Czech equity and forex markets pushed higher on Monday, buoyed by a strong showing by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus\'s rightwing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in the first round of Senate elections at the weekend.\nBut analysts warned profit taking and uncertainty leading up to a second round of voting this weekend will temper gains.\nThe Prague Stock Exchange, mired in a two-month long slump that has felled the bourse by some 16 percent, jumped 10.1 points, or 2.08 percent, at its daily price fixing to 496.8.\nBrokers expressed muted optimism at the prospect that the rise was long-term, saying that domestic investors looking for a quick rise to profit from, and not key foreign investors were at the heart of the gain.\n"There is very little foreign institutional buying as a result of the elections. It\'s mainly domestic buying. This was just the first round and the (vote) isn\'t won yet," said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Co.\nLubomir Vystavel of ING Barings added: "We had expected some speculation on the outcome of the elections.\nVystavel said the upsurge could continue into next week and beyond if ODS sustains its strong position in the second and final round next weekend, adding that the results may give cause for the long awaited rebound in Czech equities. "It is quite likely that this is the start of a trend," he said.\nThe crown also strengthened on the back of the election result, gaining around 0.3 percentage points to three percent above its dollar/mark basket in early trading, before settling at around +2.9 percent.\n"Some of those who pushed the crown up in early dealing took profits, so its dropped slightly on the index," said Petr Korous, a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.\n"There will be some bias toward a stronger crown in the coming days but I don\'t think there will be any major move -- the majority of the move was seen already today," he added.\nThe central bank fixed the crown at 2.96 percent above the basket midpoint on Monday, after fixing it at +2.45 percent on Friday.\nIn what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus\'s ODS party took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) trailing on 20.27 percent.\nThe result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus\'s three-party coalition of its majority.\nThe rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists.\nThe strong ODS showing was tempered though by poor turnout as only 35 percent of the electorate voted.\nOf the 81 Senate seats, Civic Democrats won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into next weekend\'s runoff.\nThe CSSD meanwhile, will send only 48 candidates into the second round of voting slated for Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.\n'

a(S'The Czech capital market, roundly criticised for a lack of transparency, needs an independent regulator, but it is not a panacea for all of the market\'s woes, a senior Finance Ministry official said on Tuesday.\n"Let\'s not be seduced by the illusion that as soon as an independent securities committee is created that the Czech capital market will become more refined overnight," Jan Veverka of the ministry\'s capital markets supervisory department told a conference in the Czech capital.\n"All it (the body) will do is create better conditions for the changes which can contribute to the market\'s gradual refinement," he added.\nBoth foreign and domestic investors have complained that poor legislation and a lack of enforcement of rules that do exist make the Czech capital market one of Eastern Europe\'s most opaque.\nThe soured outlook by investors has helped pull the Prague Stock Exchange down some 16 percent over the past two months, with predictions of further losses if rules do not change quickly.\nOne of the biggest problems is that legislation allows for near complete secrecy of off-market deals -- where an estimated 70 percent of trading takes place -- making it difficult for investors to determine fairly-valued shares prices.\nVeverka said when the laws governing securities trading here were devised "parliament...discarded the concept of regulation which would have given broad powers to the embryonic supervisory system out of fear that it might have abused these powers and impeded the process of creating a market economy".\nCoupled with this, he said, was the need to allow for a flood of ownership changes in the market as the mass voucher privatisation put shares in nearly 2,000 firms onto the market in a matter of months.\nNow, he said, rules must be put in place to shift trading toward the main markets to bring about more transparency.\n"Where trading takes place can be changed most effectively by ensuring an increase in the quality of the market\'s services and an end to the conditions which enable the kind of trading which is characterised by large price discrepancies," he said.\nVeverka called for a raising of the debate on creating a U.S.-style SEC oversight body "to a much higher level and preparations should be made for the creation of this body".\nBut he added: "Monitoring deals and indentifying suspicious prices or other phenomena indisputably belongs to the work of the stock market, and the market must act as a strong support to the supervisory work of the independent committee".\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n'

a(S'Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences.\nAnalysts said last weekend\'s first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further boost should be seen.\n"Provided that nothing drastic happens, it\'s pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event," Jay King, of Wood and Company, told Reuters.\nIn the first round of voting last weekend, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus\'s right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority.\nThe opposition Social Democrats were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists but only 35 percent of the electorate voted.\nOf the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties.\nAnalysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country\'s economic, or political course.\n"Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don\'t think there should be any surprises," said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.\nFollowing last weekend\'s vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.\nBut dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.\nThe crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.\nSome analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.\n"There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown," said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. "There\'s no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets."\nCitibank\'s Maly added: "I wouldn\'t foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market."\n-- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n'

I don\'t think there should be any surprises," said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.\nFollowing last weekend\'s vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.\nBut dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.\nThe crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.\nSome analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.\n"There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown," said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. "There\'s no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets."\nCitibank\'s Maly added: "I wouldn\'t foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market."\n'

a(S'Sweden beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in a World Cup ice hockey game on Thursday, setting up a showdown for European group supremacy against Finland and leaving the reigning world champions searching for answers.\nThe fast-skating Swedes seized control of the game from the opening faceoff, forcing the Czechs to take several early penalties and keeping its vaunted offense in check.\nToronto Maple Leaf winger Mats Sundin opened the scoring midway through the first period when he sped around the Czech defense and pulled Dallas Stars\' goalie Roman Turek across the crease before sliding the puck between the netminder\'s legs.\nThe Swedish National Hockey League (NHL) connection struck again early in the second frame when Washington Capital defenseman Calle Johansson blasted a slapshot from the blue line past a screened Turek with only 57 seconds gone.\nTurek, voted best goalie at the world championships for the past two years, was once again screened when a weak shot from Jonas Bergqvist found the bottom corner of the net to close out the scoring for the undefeated Swedes.\nThe Czechs came into the tournament riding high after capturing the world title in Vienna in May, but have lost the first two games of the tournament and are in danger of crashing out despite having their version of the "Dream Team".\nWith the addition of Pittsburgh Penguins duo Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved, Montreal Canadiens sharpshooter Martin Rucinsky and the core of the world championship team in tact, the Czechs were looking to prove they belonged at the pinnacle of the hockey world.\nThe match at Prague\'s Sports Hall was to be a homecoming of sorts for the Czechs, their first home game since beating Canada 3-2 in a thrilling world championship final on a last minute goal.\nBut after a demoralising loss to Finland in its tournament opener on Tuesday, and another listless effort on Thursday, Czech fans had had enough, pelting the Czech bench with beer cans near the end of the game.\nEven Czech coach Ludek Bukac, a veteran coach with almost 30 years behind the bench, was left searching for an answer to his sputtering offense and the team\'s lack of dynamism.\n"The Swedes played well, you\'ve got to hand it to them. But the fact that we didn\'t score at home is not a very good showing," he said.\nAdded Jagr: "We aren\'t that bad, but our performance is not showing it."\nBukac, who has often expressed his disdain for bringing in players who have talent but not team spirit refused to comment on whether he would invite the same team back if he could do it all again.\nBut with nine players on the roster with seven or less of national team games under their belts, the Czech players know they must come together quickly, or face the embarassment of failing to win in what is touted as the true battle for hockey supremacy.\n"We\'ve got to concentrate on winning against Germany and moving on to the next round, nothing else," added Robert Reichel, who recently re-signed with the Calgary Flames after playing one year in Germany.\nThe win allows Sweden to keep pace with group leaders Finland, who have also won both their games so far but have a better goal difference.\nThe two teams meet on Sunday in Stockholm while the Czechs must regroup and beat winless Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday to move into the quarterfinals next week in North America.\n'

a(S'The party of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took a solid lead in Senate election run-offs on Saturday, but turnout was dismal despite an appeal to vote from President Vaclav Havel.\nWith almost half the 81 constituencies declared, Klaus\'s Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had won 19 seats in the new upper house, ahead of the opposition Social Democrats with eight.\nThe Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus\'s centre-right coalition, put in a strong perfomance to take seven while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won two.\nTurnout was just 30.5 percent, lower even than the 35 percent recorded in the first round of the Senate polls on November 15 and 16, the Central Election Commission said.\nBefore the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house.\nThe Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus\'s coalition, which lost its lower house majority in elections six months ago. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance.\nFinance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, an ODS member, forecast that the government parties would take control of the Senate.\n"It is clear that the coalition is leading at the moment and I think they still will be after the final results are out," Kocarnik told reporters, predicting that the ODS would win between 33 and 40 seats.\nAnalysts had forecast that voter apathy would benefit the ODS which is well-organised and well-funded by big business.\nIts supporters, largely more affluent Czechs who have benefited from Klaus\'s free market reforms since the 1989 fall of communism, have been galvanised by the coalition\'s loss of its majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies in June.\nKlaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the little-reformed communists to turn back the clock on reform.\nScepticism is widespread among Czechs and Klaus himself has questioned the need for the Senate, which was written into the Czech Republic\'s new constitution when Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992, but is only now being elected.\nThe Social Democrats have said they would scrap the Senate if they ever achieved the three-fifths majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies needed to change the constitution.\nKlaus toned down his scepticism as voting neared but only Havel has appeared enthusiastic about the idea.\nBefore the run-offs -- for the top two first round candidates in constituencies where no one won more than half the vote -- Havel appealed to citizens to turn out in much greater numbers for the sake of the Senate\'s legitimacy.\n-- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n'

a(S'The three-party coalition of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus won a majority of seats on Saturday in run-off elections to parliament\'s new upper house, the Senate.\nBut the premier\'s own party won fewer seats than expected after dominating the first round last week and voter turnout was dismal despite an appeal for Czechs to cast their ballots from President Vaclav Havel.\nWith all 81 constituencies declared, the coalition parties secured 52 seats in the Senate, the very existence of which many Czechs have questioned.\nThe result marked a turnaround for the coalition, central Europe\'s last centre-right government, which lost its majority in the more powerful lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, six months ago.\nKlaus\'s own Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won 32 seats ahead of the strongest opposition party, the Social Democrats, with 25.\nThe Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, took take 13 seats while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance, won seven.\nThe little-reformed Communists clinched two seats and two went to independents.\n"I welcome the fact that the governing coalition took two-thirds of the senatorial seats, and that\'s a huge victory over the opposition," said Klaus, who sits in the lower house along with all other government ministers.\n"The result in the second round isn\'t any surprising victory, but on the other hand the real fact that ODS has about 40 percent of the senators I would have to mark as successful."\nThe Central Election Commission reported that second round turnout was around 30 percent, lower even than the 35 percent registered in the first round held on November 15-16.\nThe centre-left Social Democrats, whose strong gains in June lower house elections stripped the coalition\'s majority, were saved the embarassment of a Senate dominated solely by their arch-rivals from Klaus\'s party.\n"I am pleased that Senate will be a place of democratic discussion, and never the place of arrogant domination of one or another political party," Milos Zeman, the chairman of the Social Democrats and the lower house, told reporters.\nZeman\'s party has been beset by internal bickering since June, but the results of the run-offs -- between the top two first-round candidates in constituencies where nobody won more than half the vote -- could have been worse for the opposition.\n"Most importantly the Senate won\'t be one-coloured or two-coloured as was expected, but multi-coloured," said analyst Jiri Pehe of Prague\'s Open Media Research Institute.\nBefore the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house but opinion surveys showed many had no interest.\nThe Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus\'s coalition. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance.\nKlaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the Communists to turn back the clock on reform, and his supporters were galvanised by the coalition\'s June setback.\n'

a(S'A strong showing in runoff Senate elections at the weekend may breathe new life into the Czech governing coalition, but it will do little to resuscitate the country\'s dormant capital market, analysts said on Sunday.\nThe minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats.\nThe Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June.\nBut analysts said that while the news could have been worse for investors, the strong centre-right showing does nothing to solve the maladies which continue to plague the market.\n"I think the market\'s reaction will be fairly positive, but in a few weeks time it will probably have settled down into acknowledging that this has not changed the situation of the past four or five months at all," Charles Robinson of the research house HILFE told Reuters.\n"It has just not made it worse," he added.\nThe coalition\'s strong showing in the first round of voting last week helped spur domestic investor interest, pushing the market up in its wake.\nAnalysts said, however, that with this fillip already built into prices, stocks will probably not rise too much further in the near future.\nThe Czech crown also gained some ground against its dollar/mark basket on the back of the first round results, but it too should not rise significantly on the final outcome of the vote, they added.\n"It seems that the final results of the elections reflect the current structure of the political situation here so I don\'t expect any significant changes or amy development as a result of it," said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.\nAnalysts said that until legislation is tightened to bring about more market transparency and stronger minority shareholder protection, key foreign investor interest will remain low.\n"I think there has been a result built into the market from the good Senate results last week, and everyone expected that the coalition would win this second round," said one analyst.\n"There are still other difficulties that will keep the market relatively depressed such as a lack of regulation that will keep foreign investors away. This is a more important issue over the medium-term than the Senate elections."\n'

a(S'The Prague Stock Exchange hit a new year-high on Thursday as major banking issues broke out of a recent slump to spur the bourse higher.\nKomercni Banka and Ceska Sporitelna, the country\'s two largest banks both posted strong gains to help push the PX50 index up 3.3 points, or 0.58 percent, to a 1996 high of 574.9.\nOverall, advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners by 320 to 298, with 192 holding steady. Total volume remained steady at 916,194 shares on turnover of 648.3 million crowns.\nKomercni, a likely recipient of attention from investors looking to enter the Czech market after an announcement of its inclusion into the Morgan Stanley index, jumped 99 crowns to close at 2,439.\nMeanwhile, savings bank Ceska Sporitelna also posted a strong gain of 16 crowns to 351.\n"The inclusion of the Czech Republic in the Morgan Stanley index should help boost issues like Komercni," said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Company.\nEarlier in the day, Sporitelna CEO Jaroslav Klapal announced the bank expects 1996 net profit to total 2.1 billion crowns, while gross profit will hit at least 6.1 billion.\nKlapal added that he expected the bank would pay a higher dividend in 1996 than its five crown per share dividend for last year.\n"Gross profit, before the creation of reserves and payment of taxes could be slightly above 6.1 billion crowns," Klapal said. "We are counting on dividends for this year will be higher than that of last year."\nSporitelna\'s 1995 after-tax profit, calculated according to Czech accounting standards, plummetted to 263 million crowns from a previous 980 million crowns after the bank provisioned heavily for risky loans.\nThe bank\'s 1995 gross profit was 9.17 billion crowns but the bank assigned almost an identical sum, 9.13 billion, to its reserves covering "classified" loans -- those whose likelihood of recovery ranges from doubtful to hopeless.\nKlapal did not say whether his forecasts were calculated according to Czech or international accounting standards, which vary mainly in terms of allowable write-offs and depreciation costs.\nEven though analysts agreed that the financial situation of the bank was markedly better this year than it was last year, they said shares of the bank were overvalued.\nAnalysts say they are closely watching what appears to be a strong acquisition of shares in Sporitelna by the usually secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest and the rival bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s.\n"The attractiveness of (Sporitelna) could greatly drop if Motoinvest took a more significant share in management," said Richard Podpiera analyst at the investment house Atlantk FT.\n'

a(S'Markets across Eastern Europe remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts seeing little on the horizon to break the bearish trend.\nStock exchanges in Bratislava, Bucharest, and Zagreb all lost ground on the week, while Prague and Warsaw held steady. Budapest and Ljubljana bucked the trend, rising slightly, although it appeared neither would see a sustained upturn in the near future.\nPRAGUE\nNot even a strong showing by the centre-right governing coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the Prague Stock Exchange out of its current malaise, as the PX50 index inched up 0.3 points on the week to close at 510.4.\nAnalysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little power, investors remain put off by poor market regulation.\n"I\'m a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring changes to the market," said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.\n"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic."\nInvestors have long complained that market regulation and legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little protection for minority shareholders.\nWARSAW\nThe Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week and analysts said it could extend its three-and-a-half-week horizontal trend next week as no fresh signals were in sight.\n"We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market," said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.\nBut other analysts saw the generally positive economic climate as an impulse strong enough to help the bourse climb next week above 14,000 points.\nAnalysts said the central bank deputy head\'s Tuesday comment on a possible rise in interest rates next year was bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to signficantly hurt prices.\nBUDAPEST\nHungarian shares started off the weekend strongly, boosted by a government decision to hike energy prices, but they ran out of steam by the middle of the week.\nOil and gas company MOL led the charge, but dealers said its weakening on Thursday could be a harbinger.\n"MOL turned around today (on Thursday), that is a warning sign," said New York Broker\'s Kalman Schuszter. "Sellers are stronger now."

a(S'Financial services and property group Liberty International vowed on Thursday to change the way the British pensions market works with the launch of a new user-friendly subsidiary.\n"The market is poised for change, requiring a fresh approach, and our company will provide this by demystifying pensions for everybody - both individuals and the companies for which they work," Liberty chairman Donald Gordon said.\nLiberty has set up its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, and will target retail pensions and money purchase pension schemes -- pensions where the benefit is linked to the amount an individual has put in.\nLiberty, 69 percent owned by South Africa\'s Liberty Life, has enrolled the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme, which will pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions.\nLiberty\'s Gordon said the move into the British pensions market was an extension of a worldwide shift from defined benefit -- where an individual\'s pension is related to his final salary -- to defined contribution principles.\nThis would have "a most profound influence on business practice and retirement savings in the future". In Britain there is also "an urgent and growing need for quality privatised retirement savings which require a radical change in approach and funding techniques", Gordon added.\nA rapidly ageing population and low birth rate were combining to increase this need, Gordon said.\nLiberty also announced it had teamed up with fund management group Hermes to form Hermes Liberty International Pensions. This will offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.\nBT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture "critical mass from the outset" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Gordon said.\nHe said Hermes\' expertise in investment management and track record would help the group to provide quality and competitively priced pension services. Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.\n"Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that\'s a very good marriage," Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.\n"It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us."\nHe said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.\nAs well as selling pensions directly by telephone, Liberty also plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said. ($1=.6395 Pound)\n'

a(S'Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes.\nLiberty is establishing its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, which will target both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions.\nBT Pension Scheme, which owns Hermes, is to pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions, with the rest held by Liberty.\nLiberty and Hermes said in a joint statement they were also setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.\nBT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture "critical mass from the outset" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Liberty\'s chairman Donald Gordon said.\nGordon said Liberty was "well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry." Hermes\' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services.\nDavid Fischel, Liberty\'s managing director, said Liberty International Pensions still required approval of Britain\'s Department of Trade and Industry but was otherwise ready for launch.\nHermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.\n"Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that\'s a very good marriage," Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.\nRoss Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.\n"It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us."\nHe said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.\nThe decision by the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme to transfer assets to the new Hermes Liberty International Pensions funds would give the new venture a boost.\n"I would hope it gives some people some feeling of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this," he said.\nLiberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.\nFischel said an announcement would be made on exactly how the retail customer business would work at a future date, adding he could not give details at present.

a(S'A high-profile purge at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell of any managers found to bear responsibility for failing to spot irregular dealings by former fund manager Peter Young is expected next week, banking sources said on Friday.\nThe investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank is due to complete a preliminary report with accountants Ernst &amp; Young into what went wrong internally and led to the suspension of three Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) funds last month and Young\'s dismissal for alleged "gross misconduct".\nTrading in the three funds, which totalled around 1.4 billion pounds ($2.21 billion) and were held by around 90,000 retail investors, was temporarily suspended early in September but resumed after Deutsche stepped in with a 180 million pounds cash injection.\nYoung, who has had his assets frozen and his passport impounded, is currently under investigation by Britain\'s Serious Fraud Office, which probes major financial crime.\nHe has said he was not guilty of any criminal activity and is being made a scapegoat for failings.\nA probe into his management of two of the funds in question, which held too high a proportion of unlisted, speculative stocks has been underway since problems emerged.\nBoth MGAM and investments watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) have undertaken their own inquiries with forensic accountants carrying out a detailed dissection of trading history of the funds.\nIMRO\'s own investigation, which could lead to hefty punishments against the firm, will take longer to conclude.\nThere have been conflicting reports over what the ramifications of any sackings following the debacle would be.\nAs head of the asset management arm Keith Percy\'s position will inevitably be under review but some British newspapers have suggested key MGAM clients are opposing any action against him while others are said to be threatening to withdraw assets if he stays.\nA similar quandary is reported to be exercising the minds of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) officials in London and the Deutsche Bank hierarchy in Frankfurt.\nOther key managers, including Glyn Owen, MGAM\'s chief European investment officer and Mike Wheatley, compliance director for the fund management business are also likely to face scrutiny because of their executive responsibilities.\nDeutsche Morgan Grenfell said it could not comment on speculative newspaper reports, but the group said when problems first surfaced that it would produce a preliminary report within six weeks.\n"We can\'t comment on any such speculation and we have always pointed out that we would announce potential management decisions after the internal investigation has been finalised," a DMG spokesman in London told Reuters.\nFrom the beginning Deutsche has made it clear that it would take any action deemed necessary to restore confidence in its fund management business and if lapses in internal controls were found, heads would roll.\nBut despite difficult decisions emerging in the intervening weeks, Deutsche\'s resolve to give its fund management arm and by association its investment banking operation a clean bill of health, has not faltered, banking sources said.\n($1=.6350 Pound)\n'

a(S'Shares in Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) advanced on Tuesday after investors welcomed news of a deal with NYNEX of the United States and Bell Canada International to create Britain\'s largest cable operator.\n"This was a bold strategic stroke by the (C&amp;W) chief executive," said Chris McFadden, analyst at Merrill Lynch.\nThe deal, which took only five weeks to complete, brings together C&amp;W\'s Mercury, British cable company Videotron, Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX CableComms, eclipsing Telewest as Britain\'s biggest cable operator.\nIt sent C&amp;W shares soaring, peaking at 476.5 pence before easing back to close up 25.5 at 466.5 pence.\nThe move is a landmark deal for C&amp;W chief executive Richard Brown, appointed five months ago, and follows the collapse of merger talks earlier this year between C&amp;W and its great rival British Telecommunications Plc.\n"The logic is irrefutable...the advantages of scope and size are undoubtedly there," said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst John Tysoe.\nBT said it welcomed the consolidation in the sector and analysts said the move could strengthen the telecoms giant\'s calls for it to be allowed to provide cable television.\nBut BT\'s shares edged lower to close down 4.5 at 353.5 pence and analysts said the new company would give BT a run for its money.\n"We had a common vision of what could be done and we have done it with speed and nimbleness," Brown told Reuters. C&amp;W last month replaced BT in a major German alliance with diversified utility RWE that is seen as the main competitor to Deutsche Telekom\'s dominance as the German market is liberalised.\nThe new merged company, which will provide integrated telecommunications, information and entertainment services, will give C&amp;W\'s telephone company Mercury access to 18 million business and domestic customers, Brown said.\nThe number of homes within its sights will eclipse former market leader Telewest\'s two million at 2.47 million but it will not be in direct competition as the companies operate in different franchises.\nTelewest\'s shares were boosted by the news, as analysts re-evaluated the potential in the sector, gaining 12.5 pence to close at 135.5 pence.\n"This is clear evidence of confidence in the future of the U.K. cable industry," a spokesman for industry body the Cable Communications Association, said.\nAround six billion pounds ($7.5 billion) has already been invested in laying out cable networks and a further six billion pounds of investment is planned, the spokesman added.\nIn a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex transaction involving a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable &amp; Wireless. This values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.\nOnce the merger and Videotron deal have been completed, Cable &amp; Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company -- to be called Cable &amp; Wireless Communications -- with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent.\nThe remaining 15 percent will be floated, which analysts said would give it some scarcity value, with listings planned in both London and New York, probably in about six months.\nC&amp;W\'s Brown said he could not detail the financial aspects of the merger because of the new company\'s planned listing.\nMcFadden said cost savings should be quite significant, including tax offsets, refinancing of high-yield cable television funding and possibly through staff cuts, along with eliminating duplication in laying cables.\nThe new group aims to increase revenues by providing a wider range of services to existing customers, offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access.\nIt could also secure more favourable terms for programming from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Rupert Murdoch\'s News Corp has a 40 percent stake.\nBSkyB shares ended down 18 pence at 678.5 pence.

This is likely to take place in about six months, C&amp;W added.\nCable &amp; Wireless Communications "...will provide local, national, international, data and mobile telecommunications, together with multichannel television and Internet services" to around six million franchised homes and to businesses throughout Britain, the groups said in a statement.\nRichard Brown, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, said the new company would be the only company in Britain able to offer multiple services that until now people had to get from different providers.\n"Cable &amp; Wireless Communications will be the only company in the UK capable of offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access," Brown said in a statement.\nThe companies outlined a number of benefits from the new company, saying it would increase its revenues by providing a wider range of services to existing customers and increased access to a broader customer base.\nIt would also produce "significant cost savings" by eliminating duplication, enhancing purchasing power increasing capital expenditure efficiencies, they added.\nAs well as the services it will be able to offer immediately, the new company will be strategically positioned to offer new products such as interactive digital services and multi-media products "as they become available", they said.\n'

a(S'Britain\'s largest home loan lender, Halifax Building Society, said on Thursday it was confident of avoiding any takeover attempt when it floats on the stock market and sheds mutuality for bank status next June.\n"We think we can stand on our own feet," David Gilchrist, Halifax\'s director of corporate affairs said.\nThe society, currently owned by its savers and borrowers, gave details of the timetable for conversion and flotation, which analysts have said could be worth 10 billion pounds ($16 billion).\nThe building society\'s nine million members will vote early next year on the conversion, which it is billing as the largest single extension of private share ownership in Britain.\nGilchrist said a decision to transfer its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose five-year protection against takeover but underlined its confidence.\nAnalysts said the consolidation of Britain\'s financial services market is likely to continue, which could make the large and successful Halifax a possible target.\nThe flotation will project the society into the top 25 companies in London\'s blue chip FTSE 100 stock index and Gilchrist said he was confident that shareholders would be convinced by its past performance to reject any bid attempt.\nThe concersion method raises the voting threshold needed for the plans to go ahead, but Gilchrist said he believed the necessary 50 percent of investing members entitled to vote would be met.\n"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned," he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.\n"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing," Gilchrist said.\nBut members eagerly expecting to find out how big a windfall they are likely to receive when they receive free shares will have to wait until January before getting any indication.\nThe Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to and indicate their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions.\nGilchrist said members would get a "broad idea" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.\nHe also declined to comment on the cost of the conversion exercise. But it seems likely to provide a boon to Britain\'s postal service and the printing industry as well as the financial and legal advisors working on the plans.\n"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail," he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote "as quickly as possible" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.\n"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares," he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 pounds in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.\nIf eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they "may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.

a(S'Britain\'s Halifax Building Society is confident of avoiding any takeover attempts once it sheds its mutual status and becomes a publicly quoted bank in June next year, a senior official said on Thursday.\n"We think we can stand on our own feet," David Gilchrist, Halifax\'s director of corporate affairs said in a telephone interview following the announcement of the timetable for the planned conversion and 10 billion stg flotation.\nThe building society\'s nine million members -- its savers and borrowers -- will vote on the conversion early next year.  \nGilchrist said the building society\'s decision to convert by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose a five-year protection against takeover.\nIt will also increase the voting threshold needed to give the plans the go-ahead. But he was confident that it would achieve a sufficiently high vote in favour, of at least 50 percent of all investing members entitled to vote.\n"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned," he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.  \n"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing," Gilchrist said.\nEarlier, the Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme in January 1997. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.\nGilchrist said members would get a "broad idea" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.  \nHe also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs.\n"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail," he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote "as quickly as possible" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.  \n"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares," he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nBut it was working on the basis that a "large number" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added.\nThose who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.\nIf eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they "may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n'

a(S'The "Big Bang" maintained London as one of the world\'s financial hubs, but 10 years on the role of specialised financial "boutiques" at the heart of the City is under mounting pressure from huge integrated investment banks.\n"The wonderful time that there has been for the small boutique since Big Bang is over. The days of the single violinist are past, it\'s time for the full orchestra," one banking source told Reuters.\nThe so-called Big Bang of 1986 brought about radical reforms in the way the London Stock Exchange and the British government bond market operated, principally by allowing mergers between merchant banks, brokers and stock jobbers.\nIt saw the demise of traditional names such as Wedd Durlacher Mordaunt and Phillips and Drew which became parts of Barclays\' investment bank BZW and of UBS respectively.\nAnd ever since the initial wave of changes investment banking giants with global aspirations have been hoovering up small players which have carved out a niche for themselves.\nU.S. EXPERIENCE SETS THE PACE\nIn the world of corporate finance this pattern of smaller firms being swallowed up by the large players is set to mirror what has taken place in the U.S., corporate financiers say.\n"I believe the world is moving away from small nimble-footed boutiques, which had a wonderful time under the Conservative government. The new world is going to be based around very big cross-border corporate finance. You need a very big broking arm behind you," one corporate financier said.\nThis need for broking capacity and a dwindling number of independent brokers, combined with increasing regulatory demands for capital, has shrunk the opportunities for boutiques. Even in the growing derivatives market, the amounts of capital needed to play the global markets mean small outfits are hard to sustain.\nBOUTIQUES THREATENED BY EUROPE INTEGRATION\nApart from the possibility of an opposition Labour government and perhaps greater restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, with the need for companies to prove that a takeover is in the public interest, the other threat to corporate finance boutiques comes from European integration.\nIncreased bureaucracy and more rigorous European Commission demands on the companies involved in takeovers will mean even greater research capabilities and legal back-up are required by the financiers advising companies on such deals, bankers say.\n"Boutiques won\'t be much good if you have got to take a huge team of analysts and brokers out to Brussels every time you are planning a deal," said one.\nWith U.S. investment banking mammoths such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch building increasing roles in corporate finance as well as their traditional broking and trading strengths, this is also putting pressure on the small corporate finance players.\nHAMBRO MAGAN FALLS TO NATIONAL WESTMINSTER\nA recent casualty is J Hambro Magan, which two weeks ago was sold to NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain\'s National Westminster Bank, for an estimated 80 million pounds ($127.3 million).\nThe prominent corporate finance boutique was set up by George Magan in 1988 and has been involved in some of the biggest mergers and acquisitions in Britain in recent years.\n"The new world is going to be dominated by the very big boys," another banker said.\nSome commentators say the future of small boutiques is not as bleak as it may appear. They see the demise of some as merely part of a cycle which will spawn new dynamic teams based around talented individuals who may decide to leave a large established firm, take clients and expertise with them, and go it alone.\n"It\'s an on-going process. It\'s always postulated every time there\'s a rash of takeovers that boutiques are going out of fashion. But it\'s the same process as Big Bang. Small firms have developed since. Some have disappeared and been replaced by others," a banking analyst at one U.S. investment bank said.\nIn cases such as Hambro Magan, the cycle has turned full circle, with the key individuals making significant financial gains for themselves by selling a highly successful business at its peak and coming back into the folds of a larger player.\nSMALL FIRMS CAN SELL PERSONALISED SERVICE\nBut while small firms will never compete for the truly global roles, there is still a place for the personalised localised service offered by boutiques. "There\'s always a demand for that type of service," he added.\nOthers agree that in a world where investment banks are attempting to become so-called "one-stop shops", the pressures to sell clients an entire package of products could in fact enhance the position of boutiques, whose advice is perhaps more truly independent as they don\'t have other axes to grind.\nDRESDNER KLEINWORT BUYS LUTHY BAILLIE\nAnother boutique to have fallen prey to a multi-national banking player with plenty of capital behind it, sophisticated trading and broking operations and global ambitions is the bond specialist Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick &amp; Co.\nIt was snapped up only two weeks ago by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking division of Germany\'s second largest commercial bank Dresdner Bank.\nPeter Luthy, one of the founders of the 15-person bond boutique which was set up in 1990, said the firm\'s reliance on a market undergoing significant changes because of the interest rate environment and the constraints of size had forced it to seek embrace of a larger partner.\n"We learned a hell of a lot. But our business skills are better used in a big firm. The opportunities are better in a big firm," Luthy told Reuters recently.\nSuch changes will not necessarily end with the small firms such as Luthy\'s. Banking analysts and corporate financiers alike have for some time been predicting the days are numbered for what one called the "super-boutiques".\nThis dwindling list of traditional British merchant banks includes Cazenoves, NM Rothschilds, Hambros, Schroders and Robert Fleming. Takeovers here are complicated in some cases by family holdings, but strategic alliances have been suggested as an acceptable alternative in order to compete globally.\n"I think even the super-boutiques are going to be struggling over the next five years," the first banking source said.

a(S'Lloyd\'s insurance market on Tuesday welcomed a crucial U.S. district court ruling in its favour and said it would extend a deadline for acceptances of a 3.2 billion pound ($5.5 billion) recovery plan.\n"We have decided in the circumstances we will keep the offer open," Lloyd\'s chairman David Rowland said after a district court in Baltimore, Maryland, overturned an injunction by U.S. Names -- as investors in the market are known -- who were unhappy with the plan.\nRowland did not say how long the deadline would be extended from noon (1100 GMT) on Wednesday, but insurance sources said it would probably be stretched for several days to allow more U.S. Names to approve the plan.\nA Lloyd\'s spokesman said the ruling had removed the last major legal obstacle to the 300-year-old insurance market\'s recovery plan, aimed at ending years of turbulence triggered by huge liabilities.\nLloyd\'s earlier said more than 82 percent of its 34,000 worldwide members had approved the plan, but only 53 percent of the 2,700 U.S. names had given the go-ahead.\n"Since we won the appeal, faxes have been flooding in from U.S. Names accepting the settlement offer," a Lloyd\'s spokesman said by telephone.\nLloyd\'s hopes the support shown by Names will be enough to declare the plan unconditional when its ruling council meets on Thursday. The plan still has to be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry.\nLloyd\'s problems began in the 1980s when a fatal combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of unexpected natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds.\nLong standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses.\nA spokesman for one of the three key litigating British action groups representing major loss-making Names described the successful appeal as "very good" for the recovery plan.\n"I think we did better by the settlement than by going through the courts," said the spokesman for the Merrett 418 Names Association, which groups 1,932 members.\nUnder the proposals, Lloyd\'s will reinsure its massive liabilities in a new company called Equitas. It is asking investors to help fund Equitas but has offered them a compensation package to help offset their losses.\nRowland said he was delighted by the U.S. ruling, which overturned a injunction granted by a lower court to a group of U.S. Names who wanted more time to study the terms of the settlement.\n"I am very pleased. I have believed for a long time that what we are doing is in the interest of the whole society," Rowland told Reuters, adding he did not want to exclude anyone from the offer.\nMany of the market\'s pre-1993 liabilities stem from pollution and asbestosis related claims in the United States, some of them dating back even to the last century.\n'

a(S'Britain\'s Invesco Plc Monday agreed to merge with Houston-based mutual fund company AIM Management Group Inc. in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, creating one of the world\'s largest investment management businesses.\nThe deal is the largest in U.S. fund history, industry experts said.\nThe combined group will be called Amvesco Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger will be paid for with about $1.1 billion in new stock and the rest in cash and debt, Invesco officials said.\n"We are creating a prototype company for the future," Bob McCullough, Invesco\'s chief financial officer, said in an interview.\nInvesco Chairman Charles Brady, who will lead the combined group, said it would have "the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry."\nMcCullough stressed the deal was a merger of the two companies, which would focus on growing revenue but retain their individual identities.\n"They\'re buying themselves into the U.S. money management market," said Bruce Brewington, an equity analyst at Putnam, Lovell &amp; Thorton, an investment banking firm in San Francisco.\nMartin Cross, analyst at UBS, said Invesco is buying at the top of the Wall Street market, which many experts see as overpriced. He said UBS strategists are forecasting a 15 percent downward correction in the Dow Jones industrial average next year, and if it occurs, it would leave AIM looking rather expensive.\n"The deal is exquisitely timed for the AIM shareholders and conversely not so exquisitely for Invesco shareholders," Cross said.\nInvesco said it would fund the deal by issuing 290 million new shares to AIM shareholders. These would be valued at about $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the merged company.\nMcCullough said another $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt.\nThe merger presented a chance for the two companies to use different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.\nThere would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a "no-load" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM selling its nearly three dozen funds through brokers.\nMcCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive.\n"There\'s no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us," he said. The long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.\nBoth companies were "really active managers" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco\'s global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.\nHe denied the heavy exposure to the United States would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. "We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe," he said.\nThe merger would enhance the group\'s strength in the United States and lead to cost savings, officials said.\nMcCullough said the merger must be approved by Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals were required. The deal should be completed early next year, the company said.\n'

The merger values AIM at approximately $1.6 billion, Invesco said..\n"We are creating a prototype company for the future," Bob McCullough, Invesco\'s chief financial officer, told Reuters.\nBut analysts were divided as to the timing of the deal although most were happy to give Invesco the benefit of the doubt as far as its claims on synergy are concerned.\n"The deal is exquisitely timed for the AIM shareholders and conversely not so exquisitely for Invesco shareholders," said Martin Cross, analyst at UBS.\nCross argues that Invesco is buying at the top of the Wall Street market which many see as having some very stretched valuations. Cross said that UBS strategists are forecasting a 15 percent downward correction on the Dow Jones index next year which, if it came to pass, would leave AIM looking rather expensive.\nBut Phillip Gibbs at BZW was upbeat about the merger.\n"It looks rather cheap, I think they\'ve done rather nicely," Gibbs said but did add a rider on the possibility of a major correction in the US equities market.\nAnalysts said the price paid by Invesco was something short of what had been predicted but Cross said it was a "pretty full price but what one might expect for a premium company."\nInvesco shares closed unchanged at 237.5p Invesco\'s chairman and chief executive Charles Brady, the man who will lead the new group, said it would have "the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry."\nInvesco said it would fund the merger with the issue of 290 million new shares to existing holders of AIM shares. These would be valued at approximately $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the enlarged group and be subject to restrictions on selling the shares.\nMcCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said.\nThe merger is not expected to be completed before February.\nMcCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said.\nMcCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive.

a(S'British property company Greycoat Plc, under fire from a group of shareholders calling for it to be broken up, said on Monday it was confident of getting the support of its institutional shareholders in rejecting the plan.\n"I would be very surprised if they (Greycoat\'s institutional shareholders) would come down on the side of a closing down sale," Greycoat\'s chief executive Peter Thornton told Reuters.\nThornton said he believed the liquidation proposal by the UK Active Value Fund, which will be put to shareholders in 10-days time, was "ill-conceived and fails to secure shareholder value".  \nEarlier Greycoat wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject the resolution, put forward by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson, at an extraordinary general meeting on November 14.\nMyerson\'s Active Value Advisors Ltd (AVA) advises the UK Active Value Fund and is expected to put out its own response to the statement later today.\nLast month Myerson said it was time to "unlock the value of Greycoat" as the company\'s shares stood at a 23 percent discount to the forecast net asset value for 1997.\nHe said there was "considerable support" for the proposal to dispose of Greycoat\'s assets and enhance shareholder value.  \nGreycoat, which focuses on central London office developments, earlier announced a rise in interim pre-tax profits to 3.8 million stg and predicted a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share.\nThornton said the results showed the company was having a very good year, adding it was well placed to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment on the central London property market. "The whole market is moving in our direction," he said.\nThe share discount to net asset value had been worsened by the fact that UKAV held 10 percent of the shares and this was overhanging the market, he added.  \nMartin Poole, Greycoat\'s finance director, said the company had got its long-term debt in place, adding that its lender banks were not in any way ruffled by the current uncertainty.\n"The novelty has worn off from the bank\'s point of view," Poole told Reuters. To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost "roughly 10 million stg", he added.\nPoole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group\'s policy of progressively increasing it. "There is no reason why we shouldn\'t continue at the higher rate of profit," he said.  \nWhile Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment.\nThornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market.\nRather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or "possibly more". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added.\n-- London Newsroom ++ 44 171 542 7719\n'

a(S'KPMG, one of the world\'s big six international accounting and consultancy firms, believes investment in infrastructure and technology has put it on track to hasten revenue growth.\n"We would like to be growing faster and are committed to growing faster," Jon Madonna, chairman of KPMG International told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\nEarlier the group reported an eight percent rise in worldwide revenues for the fiscal year to September 30, 1996 to $8.1 billion, up from $7.5 billion the year before.\nMadonna, who earlier this year said revenue growth in excess of 10 percent was a reasonable expectation, said KPMG had invested heavily in infrastructure and technology during the year and this would pay off in terms of further growth.\nHe said all sides of the business had performed well over the year but stressed that significant growth in revenues was likely to come from the consulting side of the business rather than from the traditional backbone of auditing and tax.\n"If you look at where the great opportunity is, its on the consulting side," Madonna said.\nWhile KPMG\'s growth rate for the year was lower than rival firm Andersen Worldwide, which last month reported a 16 percent increase in 1996 revenues to $9.4 billion, Madonna said he was not disappointed with the firm\'s result.\nWhen looked at on a dollar-adjusted basis, the 1996 revenue growth was the same as for the previous year, Madonna said.\nBut there was still work to be done.\n"I said a year ago we need to be growing faster. I just think we have got to do a lot better than that. It\'s a big ship and you don\'t turn it around in just a few days," he added.\nThe investment and strategic moves KPMG had made had ensured it would be in a strong position for the future. "The road we are on is the right road".\nMadonna said the firm\'s partners were agreed that the moves it had made over the year were correct and the fact that everybody wanted faster growth confirmed the need for large-scale investments.\n"We are making sizeable dollar investments in terms of infrastructure and product development." This included around $500 million a year on technology and "well in excess" of $100 million on products.\nFor Madonna the key is what the partnership, which employs more than 77,000 people and has more than 6,250 partners, is doing in three years\' time.\nThe strategy which KPMG has embarked on will not be altered to achieve further revenue growth and areas such as developing new products and establishing a framework of common industries and a common infrastructure across the firm\'s worldwide business will continue.\nMadonna, who believes there will be further consolidation among the big accountancy firms, said KPMG will also stick to growing from within rather than through large-scale acquisition.\nThe number of major accounting firms in the world has dropped from eight in the mid-1980s to six, with a rise in competition from other types of firms.\nBut Madonna does not see KPMG making any big buys.\n"There will be local acquisitions and mergers down the road but I don\'t think anything big is on the horizon."\n'

a(S'Top managers in major financial firms need to be razor-sharp if the world\'s increasingly complex markets are to run smoothly, however sophisticated the regulatory regime, regulators and politicians said on Thursday.\n"Management needs to know its business. (It) sets the ethos of the company," Alistair Darling, spokesman on treasury affairs for Britain\'s opposition Labour party told a conference on financial regulation and minimising systemic risk.\nExamples of where rules had been broken by so-called "rogue traders" were a clear sign of management failure, he said.\nChristine Cumming, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also voiced doubts about management\'s current ability to deal with regulatory problems.\nThe health of an institution lay in its management and directors, but they were not necessarily properly armed to deal with problems when they arose, she said.\n"Do we prepare directors and managers enough?" Cumming said.\nBritain\'s often criticised regulatory system, which relies heavily on so-called "self-regulation," is also under scrutiny.\nDarling said that whichever party won the next general election, due by May 1997, the British regulatory system "will be reformed." But this would not mean "tearing everything up or dramatic change," he added.\nHe said Labour wanted to establish a regulator with sufficient "clout reputation and stature" to deal with its international counterparts.\nBut it would not create a "Super-SIB," an enlarged version of the top regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), as some commentators have suggested. A Labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulations.\nDarling\'s call for minimising the regulatory burden by making it as cost-effective as possible was echoed by most of the speakers at the conference.\nAngela Knight, Britain\'s economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wants to see a cost-benefit analysis applied to all regulations. If they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopted, she said.\nKnight also underlined the dramatic effect on the industry as a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank Barings in February 1995 was "a more salutory lesson than any regulation" to other banks and financial institutions.\nThere were calls from both politicians for interchange between industry and the regulators, so that the experiences on either side of the fence could be carried across by individuals.\nBut while the idea of the regulators being staffed by people with first-hand industry knowledge won support from many of those attending the meeting, the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movements was seen by some as a serious obstacle to this system spreading.\nAnd while regulators need to keep up with rapid changes in financial instruments and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale, they can never be expected to be one step ahead of the business they are monitoring.\n"Regulators should respond to business realities rather than be ahead of business trends," Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB told the meeting.\nThis would mean regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated to cope with the changing business environment and having to co-operate more and more with their counterparts in other countries.\n"The next generation of supervisors will have to evaluate far more complex information and make far more complex judgements," Large said.\n'

a(S'British property company Greycoat is unlikely to crumble under pressure from rebel shareholders who want it broken up or succumb to a merger approach from smaller rival Moorfield Estates, analysts said on Monday.\n"I don\'t think they are on the critical list in any sense or meaning of the word," one analyst said.\nA proposal to sell-off Greycoat\'s assets is due to be put to shareholders at a special meeting on Thursday. It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson\'s Active Value Advisers.\nUK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson\'s relationship with the firm\'s management has not run smoothly.\nThe South African financier\'s challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach.\nMoorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had "developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat".\nIt said this had been presented to some of Greycoat\'s larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat\'s chairman.\nThey include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group.\nThis would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat\'s main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged.\nMoorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of "investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company".\nThe remainder of the enlarged group would constitute "an investment, trading and development portfolio" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by "at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum", Moorfield said.\nWhile analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat\'s favourable tax position.\n"But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday," a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked "very seriously" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat.\nAnother possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said.\nMyerson\'s proposed sale of Greycoat\'s London property assets is seen by some as an unwise "forced sale" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market.\n"Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term," the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat\'s two largest properties.\n"They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive," he added.\nBut others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat\'s largest assets. "This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell," the second analyst said.\nGreycoat shares closed 6.5 pence higher at 155.5 pence while Moorfield shares were unchanged at 30.5 pence.

a(S'Final approval for Lloyd\'s of London\'s recovery plan edged closer on Wednesday as it declared that over 90 percent of members had accepted a settlement offer aimed at securing the 300-year-old insurance market\'s future.\nLloyd\'s said it had been swamped by U.S. investors signing up for its recovery plan after a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that had threatened the insurance market\'s survival. By Wednesday afternoon 66.7 percent of U.S. members had accepted.\n"The level of acceptances speaks for itself. Members have made their views toward the reconstruction of Lloyd\'s abundantly clear," Lloyd\'s chairman David Rowland said in a statement.\nEarlier a Lloyd\'s spokesman said acceptances from U.S. Names, investors in the market, had flooded in overnight.\nAlmost half of the 2,700 U.S. Names had until last night held off. Only 53 percent had accepted by Tuesday.\nThis followed a Baltimore appeal court\'s decision late on Tuesday to overturn U.S. judge Robert Payne\'s ruling last Friday to allow U.S. Names more time to consider the plan.\nPayne granted an injunction giving U.S. Names more time to consider the plan and ordered Lloyd\'s to provide further information by September 23. On Tuesday a panel of judges in Baltimore sent the case back to the Virginia district court with orders to dismiss it.\nRowland said he acknowledged many overseas members had deferred their acceptance in the light of the Virginia court judgement and the subsequent Baltimore ruling.\nOver the last few days, evidence of support for the Lloyd\'s proposals among its 34,000 investors worldwide has grown. On Tuesday evening acceptances totalled 82 percent, compared to only 75 percent on Saturday.\nWednesday\'s noon deadline for accepting the recovery plan, under which Lloyd\'s proposes Names pay to help reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas, was extended to give all a chance to respond.\nRowland said on Wednesday afternoon that in the circumstances it was "fair and proper" to exercise flexibility in pushing back the deadline for acceptances.\nLloyd\'s said that any formal, longer-term extension would be subject to a decision by its council at a Thursday meeting at which it would consider "the prospect of declaring the settlement offer acceptances unconditional."\nThis extension will crucially allow the market enough time to collect the convincing majority of acceptances, especially from U.S. Names, which it needs to prove its own solvency.\nLloyd\'s problems began in the 1980s when a destructive combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds.\nLong-standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses.\nThe market is due to submit figures to Britain\'s Department of Trade and Industry next week in an annual solvency test, and file with the U.S. Treasury and New York Insurance Department later next month.\nEquitas may lift off in two weeks if all goes as planned. The recovery plan\'s success increasingly looks likely, but another challenge by U.S. Names has not been ruled out.\nHowever, U.S. legal sources said overnight that, while U.S. investors could in theory attempt to challenge Tuesday\'s order it would be difficult to do so successfully.\nDespite that, one U.S. Name and chief negotiator for an action group known as the American Names Association, Kenneth Chiate, said he expected U.S. Names to appeal the Baltimore ruling.\n'

a(S'British merchant bank Hambros, under fire from a rebel Hong Kong shareholder calling for its breakup, reported a return to first-half profit on Wednesday and said the benefits of restructuring should begin to show through.\n"We have great confidence in ourselves and what we are trying to do," Sir Chips Keswick, the group\'s chief executive, said in an interview.\nHe dismissed efforts by Hong Kong investment manager Regent Pacific Group, which holds three percent of Hambros, to break up the firm in an attempt to realise shareholder value.\n"Regent is a three percent shareholder and is perfectly entitled to (its) views. We are perfectly entitled not to share them," Keswick said.\nHambros reported pretax profits of 35.0 million pounds ($57.81 million) for the first half, compared with a 7.7 million pound loss for the same period in 1995.\nSome analysts had forecast pretax profits of up to 45.0 million pounds based on a strong performance by Hambros\' estate agent subsidiary Hambro Countrywide.\nThey also predicted an interim dividend range of between 2.5 and 3.0 pence. In the event the dividend was unchanged at 2.5 pence.\nHambros is among a dwindling list of British investment banks which are the constant subject of takeover speculation. However, it has been seen as one of the less attractive targets due to recent poor performance and major provisions for bad debts.\nBad debt provisions for the period were 5.9 million pounds compared with 23.5 million in the same period in 1995.\nAsked about the possibility of Hambros becomin a takeover target for a larger international player, Keswick said a public company was always in the firing line but he was happy with the group\'s direction.\nWhile he could not talk for shareholders in the group, Keswick said he had the impression from discussions with them in the wake of the Regent Pacific move that they were supportive of changes the company had implemented.\nKeswick said the group was on track to replace "low margin vanilla business" with increased return per customer business. It had decided the best strategy was to undergo major upheavals for a year rather than piecemeal changes over a longer period in order to achieve this.\nKeswick, who forecast the benefits of the changes could take a year or two to come through, said he was pleased the group had moved back into profit, adding that the Investment Group\'s result had been particularly good.\nBut Hambros chairman Lord Hambro warned that profits from this part of the business were not expected to match the first half in the rest of the year.\nHowever, he expected "considerable improvement" from Hambros\' subsidiaries and, despite a challenging environment for the group as a whole, prospects were good.\nLord Hambro said he would retire from his post in July 1997 and be succeeded by Keswick.\n"Chips will inevitably be a hands-on chairman," Michael Sorkin, deputy chairman of Hambros Bank, said.

a(S'Shareholders in British property company Greycoat on Thursday left a large question-mark hanging over the future of the group, which is currently facing a break-up demand and a merger proposal from a smaller rival.\nGreycoat shareholders postponed for three weeks a vote on a proposal to sell off the company\'s 500 million pounds ($831.5 million) portfolio in anticipation of talks with predator Moorfield Estates, run by two former Goldman Sachs property analysts.\nBut Greycoat said it still has to see concrete proposals from Moorfield, which wants a paper merger of the two and then a possible de-merger of Greycoat\'s largest property assets.\n"We have yet to see any detailed proposals from Moorfield. As we keep saying we will consider those proposals once they are received. So far we have only seen one page of vague bullet points," a Greycoat spokesman told Reuters.\nThe rebel investment fund shareholders which put forward the break-up resolution are the UK Active Value Fund, IMP UKAV Inc and Chaddesley Investments. They control 11 percent of the shares and are advised by Brian Myerson\'s Active Value Advisors.\nBut at an extraordinary general meeting South African Myerson asked shareholders to put off a vote on their proposals for a controlled programme of disposals which he has said would significantly enhance shareholder value.\nThis change in strategy came after Greycoat\'s chairman Michael Beckett told the meeting it had asked Moorfield to come up with a "full and detailed proposal" which, if forthcoming, it would "consider carefully".\nAfter a vote on postponement, carried by 53 million shares in favour versus about 42 million shares against, Myerson said, "It\'s an overwhelming vote in favour of shareholder choice. We are supportive of Moorfield in terms of its proposals. We want the board to sit down with them."\nGreycoat, which specialises in London property, said last week that the break-up resolution was not in shareholders\' best interests and urged them to reject it.\nBut news of the Moorfield approach surfaced over the weekend, adding another dimension to the uncertainty already hanging over the company and according to some analysts, holding down its share price which closed at 155-1/2p on Thursday.\nMoorfield said earlier this week that it would de-merge Greycoat\'s largest assets, its Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road properties, and had earmarked some of its developments for immediate sale to a large property company.\nIt said it plans to bring the remainder of the enlarged group\'s assets into an investment, trading and development portfolio and reorganise the board and management structure to reduce costs by at least 1.5 million pounds a year.\nMyerson told reporters after the meeting that the British property company would now be forced to talk to Moorfield. "The (Greycoat) board will be forced to sit down and look at the Moorfield proposals," he said.\nMyerson said he was delighted shareholders had voted to adjourn his original proposal and repeated that his main object was to create shareholder value.\nHe added the Moorfield proposals, which have so far been rejected by Greycoat as being too vague, had the backing of holders of 40 percent of Greycoat shares\nMyerson said these holders had already seen Moorfield\'s 40-page document and expressed their support for it, adding that he was "supportive" of both the proposals and the Moorfield management.\n"We are supportive of Moorfield in terms of its proposals and we want it (the board) to sit down with them...We expect Moorfield to refine its proposals over the next couple of weeks," he added.

a(S'Britain\'s investment watchdog on Thursday punished companies in the Robert Fleming group for rule breaches, with fines totalling 700,000 pounds ($1.09 million).\nAt the same time Hong Kong authorities secured voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million from a company jointly owned by the Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming groups.\nBritain\'s IMRO (the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) handed down a 400,000 pound fine to Robert Fleming Asset Management (RFAM) and 100,000 pound penalties to three other firms in the group, while Hong Kong\'s SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) agreed the compensation package.\nFailings exposed by the investigation were accepted by Robert Fleming Asset Management, which regretted the breaches. "We are embarrassed by it, there\'s no doubt about that," Paul Bateman, RFAM\'s chairman told Reuters in an interview.\nThe disciplinary action resulted from a five-month joint investigation by IMRO and the SFC into dealing procedures at Jardine Fleming Investment Management (JFIM) and related companies, with the co-operation of all the firms involved.\nJFIM is a member of the Jardine Fleming group,\nThe probe revealed Colin Armstrong, a former senior fund manager and director of JFIM had engaged in late allocation of deals after changes in the price of the instruments traded had occurred, the SFC said.\nHis actions had resulted in three accounts managed by JFIM losing money and led to the group agreeing to make voluntary payments totalling $19.3 million to compensate these clients.\nArmstrong made "substantial profits from trading in Japanese exchange traded options" for his own account, the SFC said. He has since cooperated With JFIM and had paid back any gains.\nThis has been used by JFIM as part of the compensation.\n"The heart of the problem is JFIM. The weakness was their back office and procedures were not up to IMRO standards," said Bateman, adding the problem had been isolated to one fund manager, but said it had exposed systemic weakness.\nWith hindsight he acknowledged that these procedural and compliance monitoring problems could and should have been spotted earlier but said it was difficult to tell how much quicker it could have been dealt with, although there had been a steady increase in the management response.\nArmstrong\'s behaviour had been an abuse of trust, but no decision had yet been made over whether it would result in court action, he added. Bateman said Armstrong had accepted the SFC termination of his registration as an investment adviser and securities dealer. ApaRt from fining the Robert Fleming subsidiaries that had delegated fund management of 1.2 billion pounds to JFIM, IMRO ended the registration of Robert Thomas, the former chief executive of JFAM and JFIM, who accepted he "bore ultimate responsibility for the compliance failures in the companies". JFAM has also had its authorisation brought to an end and the Jardine Fleming and Robert Fleming groups will offer its 10 customers\nBut IMRO denied the penalties were insufficient either as punishment or a deterrent against future breaches. "It always sends out a message to others when we take out a disciplinary action," an IMRO official told Reuters, adding the fines matched the scale of the breaches and the negative publicity would also have an effect.\nBateman said the Robert Fleming group would be in close contact with all of its clients, but said he did not expect any material loss from the findings and clients had so far been "understanding of the position".

a(S'Privately owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent.\n"We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent," a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was "a very good start" and showed new businesses were "making a valuable contribution to profitability."\n"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months," Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain\'s Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming\'s London-based fund company. In September the company\'s chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board.\nFlemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a "marginally lower" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995.\nThis was after taking into account provisions "arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years," it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on.\nHe described the events as a "painful experience." "But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand," he added.\nAny impact these problems may have had on Flemings\' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence.\nFlemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported "a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking."\nIts capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.\nThe appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders.\nWilliam Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee. Garrett will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the group.\n'

But despite widespread speculation that Jardine Fleming would lose clients as a result of the scandal, it recorded a net trading profit of $82.0 million, an increase of 28 percent.\nRobert Fleming said "the shortcomings which gave rise to these problems have been fully addressed", management had been strengthened and the Jardine Fleming businesses were fully compliant with "local and UK regulation and controls".\nThey were "being further upgraded to bring them completely in line with best international practice," it added.\nAny impact these problems may have had on Flemings\' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend paid by Robert Fleming, which announced an increased dividend of 8.0 pence per share, from 7.0 pence.\nFlemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses and its securities business had reported "a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking".\nIts capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.\nIt also announced that Manser will replace Robin Fleming who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997.

a(S'Privately-owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent.\n"We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent," a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was "a very good start" and showed new businesses were "making a valuable contribution to profitability."\n"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months," Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain\'s Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming\'s London-based fund company. In September the company\'s chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board.\nFlemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a "marginally lower" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995.\nThis was after taking into account provisions "arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years," it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on.\nHe described the events as a "painful experience." "But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand," he added.\nAny impact these problems may have had on Flemings\' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence.\nFlemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported "a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking."\nIts capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.\nThe appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders.\nWilliam Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee. Garrett will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the group.\n'

a(S'Mention moneylending to most Britons and their instant reaction is "you mean loan-sharks!".\nBut Britain\'s established credit companies, which lend to people unable to borrow from the high street banks or credit card companies, say the public image of menacing debt collectors is a far cry from how they conduct their regulated business.\n"We are credit collectors. A debt collector is someone who has no relationship with the customer. It\'s a totally different process," says Eddie Cran, chief executive of the financial services group Cattle\'s, which runs door-to-door moneylenders Shopacheck.\nSuch firms are tied closely to the wheeling and dealing of the City of London. Provident Financial, Cattle\'s and London Scottish Bank are all publicly quoted, profitable firms paying shareholders annual dividends.\nPeople who borrow from them may have had minor civil court judgements against them, be unemployed or simply not want to have bank accounts or credit cards. The firms provide a service others -- except for unregulated outfits -- will not, and while it won\'t cost a pound of flesh, it is not cheap.\nTo those used to credit cards or in-store credit the rates may appear outrageously high. But credit companies point out they include major costs such as collection and insurance, are agreed in advance and do not rise if a payment is missed.\nSo while interest rates may be at all-time lows, these service charges mean the APRs (annualised percentage rate) can exceed 150 percent. To borrow 100 pounds ($167) over 25 weeks from Shopacheck with a five pound weekly repayment costs 25 pounds.\nShopacheck, which started in the 1930s in northeast England, has 2,800 agents. Its average loan is for six months, the average amount 150 pounds and average indebtedness 350 pounds.\nSTREET COLLECTING\nOnly a few miles from the City, but a million miles from its hefty salaries and bonuses, Kathy, a self-employed agent for Shopacheck, does her weekly door-to-door collection of debt repayments through the streets of northwest London.\nThe terraced suburban houses at which she stops are remarkably average. Most have front gardens, some are neatly laid out with blooming rose bushes while others are less well-kept, with tatty patches of litter-strewn grass.\nInside there are the usual consumer trappings of late 1990s British life.\nTelevisions, video-recorders, washing machines and microwave ovens, even the odd fish tank, are all in evidence, especially when crammed into a small council flat along with children, their toys, pets and piles of ironing.\nAt each house Kathy, a 37-year-old mother of three, collects sums ranging from two pounds fifty to 20 pounds.\nSome customers take loans in the form of vouchers which can be spent only at certain high street shops, while others use the retail service offered by Shopacheck and buy items such as bed linen, beds or barbeques from the firm\'s own catalogue.\nMost of her clients seem to welcome her as a friend, they expect her visits and have the money ready to hand to her. Kathy says that, after eight years, she is a treated as a long-standing family friend or agony aunt by many of them.\nOnly at one home does the son of the house come to the door and tell Kathy that his mother isn\'t in. "Fine, can you tell her I\'ll see her as usual next week," says Kathy.\nBut getting money back isn\'t always this easy.\nKathy admits that if a customer threatens her, she passes the problem back to the company, which says it instructs its self-employed agents not to take personal risks.\nMONEYLENDERS PLUG GAP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES\n"The one thing about credit is that it is easy to give but much harder to get back," says Paul Oliver, a Shopacheck regional manager who has been in the business for 27 years as customer, agent and manager.\nHe is not alone as a successful businessman who has made use of Britain\'s long-standing system of moneylending. The managing director of one British bank confided he would not be where he is today had it not been for a money lending firm.\nHis family could not afford to buy him a suit for an interview. He took a loan, bought the essential attire, got his first job and set himself on the path to greater things.\nOliver says nine out of 10 times business is conducted with the woman of the house and although bad debts are expected, they only reach about four percent a year, which is good going for a business the mainstream lenders won\'t touch because of the risk.\nA recent television documentary showed some moneylenders breaking rules laid down by the Consumer Credit Act. Oliver says he deals harshly with anyone who steps outside the rules.\nFor Cran firms such as his are plugging a gap in Britain\'s financial services marketplace and he is keen to correct what he sees as "untrue perceptions" about the business. "What we are actually attempting to do is to deal with customers who cannot get credit through the mainstream lenders," Cran told Reuters.\n"It (door-to-door lending) is very high cost and very personal. We have to train people to look after a number of customers," he added. A customer who fails to pay is only pursued through the courts "as a very last measure" and only in "very extreme circumstances" is an outside firm called in.\nCran says Cattle\'s target market is about five-and-a-half million people, around two million of whom need the discipline of an agent calling to collect every week.\nBut the stigma involved means Cattle\'s also offers Welcome, a loans service for people who have bank accounts and pay by direct debit. This "requires a very high rejection rate and an in-depth granting procedure", Cran says.\nSHAREHOLDERS REAP THE DIVIDENDS\nFor Cattle\'s and its competitors credit is a lucrative business. In September it reported increased pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year of nearly 15.0 million pounds. In 1995 its shareholders received a total dividend of 6.9 pence.\nIn August Provident Financial, the sector\'s biggest player, reported first half pre-tax profits of 47.5 million pounds. It said it had seen continued growth in home collected credit and was confident of a "good result" for the year as a whole.\nBut for customers, things might not be so rosy. While most manage to pay back their loans, some do not. Kathy soon spots trouble. "You can see they are struggling if they start having to scrabble around for pennies," she says. ($1=.5990 Pound)\n'

a(S'British venture capital firm 3i Group Plc on Thursday reported a rise in first half net asset value (NAV) per share and revenue profits but said it had been held back by continental Europe and a strong pound.\n3i\'s NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence in the first half last year, while profit before tax rose to 62.9 million pounds ($106 million) from 54.3 million.\n"Its a pretty healthy increase. Its held back a bit by continental Europe...the markets have not been that good and there has also been the appreciation of sterling," Ewen Macpherson, 3i\'s chief executive said in an interview.\nMacpherson said a better indication of the group\'s performance was its British portfolio which had performed "extremely well", reflected in an 18 percent growth in revenue.\nThere were still plenty of opportunities available, he said, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well.\nThere had also been an improvement in general business confidence in Britain, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to 3i\'s latest "Enterprise Barometer" survey.\nOf 327 million pounds invested by 3i during the period, 284 million was in Britain.\nMacpherson said the prospect of a general election in Britain by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their corporate holdings while the tax regime remained clear.\nWhile the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said. Current pricing levels for small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were "very attractive".\nDuring the first half of the year, realisation of investments continued at an encouraging rate, with sales worth 122 million pounds in Britain and some 36 million pounds in continental Europe.\nMacpherson said the group had "significant plans to expand in Europe" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in the German city of Duesseldorf in January.\nThis regionalisation would also involve opening offices in three other German cities -- Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart -- and the group also plans to extend its presence into the south of France.\nThe group said it wanted to open its first office in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997.\nMacpherson said Asia was "an exciting part of the world" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered.\nHe said the office would look at opportunities in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia but not in China.

a(S'UK investment capital group 3i Group Plc said on Thursday the increase in its first half net asset value (NAV) per share was healthy but had been partly held back by continental Europe and a strong pound.\n"Its a pretty healthy increase. Its held back a bit by continental Europe...the markets have not been that good and there has also been the appreciation of sterling," Ewen Macpherson, 3i\'s chief executive told Reuters.\n3i\'s NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence for the same period the previous year.  \nMacpherson said a better indication of the group\'s performance was its UK portfolio which had performed "extremely well", reflected in an 18 percent growth in revenue.\nHe said there were still plenty of opportunities available, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well. There had also been an improvement in general business confidence in the UK, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter according to 3i\'s latest survey.\n"The confidence in the businesses underlying our portfolio has been so positive," he said. Of 327.3 million stg invested by 3i during the period, 284.2 million stg was in the UK.  \nMacpherson said the prospect of a general election in the UK, which must be held by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their holdings in a firm while there was no doubt about the tax implications.\nWhile the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said, adding that current pricing levels for the small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were "very attractive".  \nDuring the first half of the year, 3i said, realisations on investments had continued "at an encouraging rate". It realised investments of 122.2 million stg in the UK and 35.9 million stg in continental Europe.\nMacpherson said the group had "significant plans to expand in Europe" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in Dusseldorf, Germany in January. This regionalisation would involve opening offices in Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart.\nAnd the group was also planning to extend its presence into the south of France, he added.  \nThe group also announced it would open its first office in South East Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997.\nMacpherson said the area was "an exciting part of the world" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered.\nHe said the office would start small, with a staff of three, and would have a maximum of "half-a-dozen" people for the first year or so and would look at opportunities in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia but not in China.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7719\n'

a(S'The British arm of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, auditors for failed British bank Barings, said on Friday it had issued third party proceedings against nine former directors and employees of the bank.\n"Despite the fact that we are not responsible for the collapse of Barings, we face a substantial claim. We are perceived to have deep pockets which are available to those who have lost money while those who were really responsible for the collapse of Barings escape," Coopers said in a statement.\n"We may also take additional third party proceedings against other members of Barings management in due course," it added.\nCoopers &amp; Lybrand\'s British firm was auditor for Barings Plc, the parent company. Barings was rescued by Dutch financial giant ING Groep after it collapsed in February 1995 under losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based Nick Leeson.\nLeeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank\'s downfall.\nErnst &amp; Young, administrators to the bank, later issued claims of negligence in audits against accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in London and Singapore and Deloitte &amp; Touche in Singapore.\nSome commentators estimate the total amount of these writs, which have not been specified, to be around 1.0 billion pounds ($1.68 billion). A Coopers &amp; Lybrand official in London said no amount had been specified on the writ issued against it.\nA spokesman at Ernst &amp; Young told Reuters the firm was aware of the third party writs issued by Coopers but said that it was "inappropriate to comment at this stage."\nThe Coopers &amp; Lybrand official said the third party writs against the nine former Barings directors and employees had not yet been served, adding it had four months in which to do so.\nThe firm said in a statement that the writs had been issued in the Chancery Division of the High Court against former Baring Investment Bank head Peter Norris and former deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey as well as Ron Baker, Mary Walz, Ian Hopkins, Anthony Gamby, Geoffrey Broadhurst, James Bax and Simon Jones.\nBaker\'s lawyer, Lindsay Hill of law firm Fox Williams, told Reuters he was surprised Coopers &amp; Lybrand had taken the action against Baker.\n"I am surprised that Coopers &amp; Lybrand should have taken this sort of action against Mr. Baker. I think the way events have unfolded before the SFA (Securities and Futures Authority) have demonstrated that he has not been in breach of any of his obligations or duties as a director," Hill said.\nHe said he did not expect Coopers &amp; Lybrand to be successful in any claim against Baker and suggested that issuing the writs had been "a tactical move intended to divert attention away from the main action."\nEarlier this month Baker was cleared of most misconduct charges brought by the SFA, a British financial markets watchdog, after a hearing by an independent tribunal.\nNorris, who along with Broadhurst was banned from working in the City of London by the SFA in May, could not be contacted by Reuters.\nTuckey, who was deputy chairman of Barings, was not disciplined by the SFA. In March the SFA said it "found no evidence indicating that the insolvency of the group" could be attributed to his actions.\nBut he had to assure the SFA he would not seek any position in an investment house which would require his registration by the SFA as a senior executive officer or as a director unless his duties were limited to giving corporate finance advice.\nGamby was reprimanded by the SFA in August. He had his registration as a director suspended for a year and was required to pay 5,000 pounds towards costs.\nSFA proceedings against Walz, Hopkins and Bax have yet to be concluded, while Jones was not regulated by the watchdog.

a(S'Singapore\'s Hotel Properties and property group Canary Wharf on Friday applied for detailed planning consent for a development aimed at injecting life into an office-dominated area of London\'s former docks.\n"Life means people who stay here. We looked at what was lacking (in Canary Wharf) and that was life," Thio Gim Hock, executive director of HPL, told Reuters in an interview.\nHPL and Canary Wharf, which is owned by an international consortium led by Paul Reichmann and including Prince Al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud of Saudi Arabia, formed an 80-20 joint venture for the residential, hotel and leisure project.\nThe multi-million pound scheme represents the first phase of development of an 11-acre (4.5 hectare) site adjoining the River Thames. It will be part of the landmark Canary Wharf docklands development to the east of the City financial district, home to Britain\'s tallest building.\nThe development will be the first at the massive Canary Wharf site since an agreement last year by banks to sell out to the Reichmann-led consortium. The banks had taken over the ownership when the original development company went into administration.\nDespite these problems, 80 percent of the offices have now been occupied and Canary Wharf is vying with the London\'s traditional financial heartland as a site for large global investment banks to locate their new headquarters.\nOffice blocks have so far dominated the site, however, and Thio Gim Hock said he expects to start building 330 residential units, a five star hotel and sports club early in 1997. They are due to be completed by the end of 1998 or early 1999.\nThere is already outline planning permission from the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to develop the site and Canary Wharf\'s Robert John, a director of the joint venture, believes detailed permission should be granted.\nAn initial capitalisation of 50 million pounds ($83.95 million) will come from the partners. Further funding is expected to come from sale of apartments and bank loans, although Thio Gim Hock would not be drawn on the financing.\nHPL, which has a stake in Britain\'s Virgin Cinemas as well as interests in hotels such as Four Seasons and residential developments, said in July the Canary Wharf scheme would cost around 250 million pounds, although the total cost is likely to be higher given the estimates for the first phase.\nDesigner Philippe Stark is to shape the hotel and leisure component of the new development, which will include a glass-covered "infinity" swimming pool which will give the appearance of dropping into the river Thames below.\nThio Gim Hock said Stark will "give some sex appeal to the development", which he says will have a country club atmosphere. He wants the hotel to have its own distinctive character which will be "elegant, understated and aimed at business people".\nThe developers also envisage opportunities for top-class restaurants with river views on the site.\nHe expects many of the apartments to be sold to people in Britain, but also hopes for overseas interest and foresees some buyers seeking an investment rather than a place to live. HPL\'s track-record in Singapore will, he said, encourage interest from the company\'s home patch.\n"I have no doubt that a lot of them will come and buy here."\nWork on the Canary Wharf project in the former London docks began in 1987 under Olympia and York, owned by the Reichmann family of Canada.\nBut in May 1992 Olympia and York Canary Wharf Ltd went into administration and was rescued by a group of banks that had financed the project in October 1993.

a(S'Embattled British property company Greycoat had the immediate threat of a shareholder call for its break-up removed on Thursday, but the firm still faced an unwanted merger proposal from a smaller rival.\nGreycoat welcomed an overwhelming vote against the breakup resolution put forward by the UK Active Value Fund (UKAV) and chief executive Peter Thornton said he hoped the group could now get on with its normal business.\n"It has cost us a lot of money and a lot of wasted effort and time. What we would like to do is get on with running a property company," Thornton said in an interview.\nHe was speaking after the vote by Greycoat shareholders on UKAV\'s call for the sale of all Greycoat\'s 500 million pound ($811.6 million) assets. Among Greycoat sharholders, 95 percent of those who voted, representing 55 percent of the share capital, voted against the sale.\nShares in Greycoat closed unchanged at 163.5 pence, compared with a year high of 168 pence and a low of 130 pence.\nUKAV, which is advised by South African Brian Myerson\'s Active Value Advisers, said on Wednesday it would abstain at the reconvened extraordinary general meeting.\nIt argued it had already achieved one of its main aims, the sale of Greycoat\'s largest asset, Embankment Place, on the River Thames in central London.\nIt now thought a merger proposal from Moorfield Estates had "considerable merit and could better serve the interests of Greycoat shareholders".\nThornton welcomed the fact that one uncertain element surrrounding the group was over, adding Greycoat had yet to receive the answers needed about the Moorfield merger proposal.\n"We still haven\'t received answers to our 30-odd questions," he said of the Moorfield approach, adding Greycoat was not prepared to embark on a due diligence exercise or open its books to Moorfield without more concrete details of the firm\'s plans.\nMoorfield has suggested demerging Greycoat\'s largest assets, but Thornton said it had yet to convince him it had proposals that would work.\nMoorfield shares were also unchanged at 30.5 pence, compared with a year high of 34 pence and a low of 24 pence.\nThornton said relations with potential purchasers had been established but there were fairly few buyers in the world able to pay more than 200 million pounds ($324.6 million).\nBut he said he could not quantify how much losing the opportunity of an "off market" sale might shave off the sale price.

a(S'British property group MEPC on Thursday announced a 14 percent increase in pretax profits for the year but said a writedown on a Los Angeles shopping mall had reduced its net asset value (NAV).\nMEPC\'s chief executive said he was pleased with the rise in pretax profits to 140 million pounds ($227.2 million) from 122.6 million pounds the previous year, but admitted disappointment at the fall in NAV to 450 pence per share from 457 pence.\nMEPC shares were 11p lower at 441-1/2p by 1218 GMT as traders said the NAV was below market expectations.\n"We feel very confident about the whole of the profit statement. The only slight disappointment is on the NAV side," Tuckey said in an interview. Earnings per share rose nine percent to 22.9 pence and the total dividend stayed at 20 pence.\nTuckey said the NAV drop reflected a marginal fall in values both in Britain and elsewhere but it was less than the relevant indices. "We feel that the performance of our UK portfolio, which accounts for 70 percent of the group, is indeed where we would have expected it to be."\nHe pointed out the valuation date for the portfolio was August 31 and there had been activity and evidence of an improved market since then. "If we redid the valuation for December 1, we would probably get a different answer," he said.\nThe other factor which had brought the NAV down was the 31 million pound write-down on the valuation of MEPC\'s Northridge Mall. This had been equivalent to 7.5 pence per share.\n"We are convinced this is a temporary write-down because the centre is still getting back on its feet after the earthquake some three years ago. We are quite confident we will get that value back in the next two to three years as the centre re-establishes itself," he said.\nAnd he defended MEPC\'s decision to give a target NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001.\n"We\'re sticking our necks out...The portfolio is very very different to what it was three years ago and what we\'re trying to do is give shareholders some feel of where we think the performance is going to be in five years time," Tuckey said.\nTuckey said the full impact of the change of strategy in MEPC\'s portfolio would take time but there would be progress towards the firm\'s targets each year.\nHe said there was a much firmer tone to the markets, particularly in Britain over the last few months. Apart from Northridge, the rest of the U.S. portfolio had performed "extremely well".\nMEPC plans to keep the lion\'s share of its portfolio in Britain, with the remainder in the United States and Australia. It has wound down its European portfolio and has no plans to go back into continental Europe in the immediate future.\nTuckey said the group was keen to make acquisitions, with the proceeds of its European disposals, but that there was a shortage of good stock available, particularly in Britain.\nWhile MEPC has resolved to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, Tuckey said he could not predict when it would be increased although he pointed out that dividend cover had improved to 1.15 times from 1.05 a year before.\n"It depends on the forward look, on how the markets are feeling," he said. The market was competitive and good stock was hard to find but Tuckey said he welcomed the prospect of changes to the way the market functioned with more liquidity likely.\n($1=.6161 Pound)\n'

a(S'It may sound like a dull backwater but the role of compliance has again been thrust into the limelight as yet another respected financial institution was rapped by the authorities this week for breaking the rules.\nCompliance officials play a key role in banking and finance, ensuring procedures to safeguard against fraud and malpractice are adhered to from the back office to the board room.\nOn Thursday British investment watchdog IMRO fined companies in the Robert Fleming group 700,000 pounds ($1.09 million) and Hong Kong\'s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) secured voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million from a Robert Fleming and Jardine Matheson joint venture.\nThese punishments stemmed from compliance violations which also saw two individuals banned from the markets.\nA compliance officer at a top international investment bank, who did not want to be named, told Reuters the irregular dealing leading to the probe was "as old as the hills".\nAnd it was something the right checks and balances should have avoided. "I\'m surprised that something as old as this has cropped up again. It\'s the sort of thing that any compliance officer worth his salt should have his eye open for," he added.\nThe joint IMRO and SFC investigation revealed that Colin Armstrong, a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management, had made profits for his own account by the late allocation of deals, thereby depriving client accounts.\nCompliance industry insiders said a number of red flags might have warned those in charge that something was amiss far earlier and thereby prevented much of the damage.\nLarger-than-life characters and big earners are often left to their own devices and not investigated until too late.\nCompliance officers first started appearing in London firms about 10 years ago, but the profile has changed significantly over this period, with many coming from the ranks of accountants and lawyers and seeking a career in the area.\nIndustry sources say top-ranking individuals can now earn as much as 100,000 pounds a year, including bonuses, which although falling short of what dealers earn, is attracting good people.\nFor a system of compliance with both internal and external rules and regulations to be wholly effective, the personnel involved not only need to be top notch, they must also have adequate resources and the full backing of senior management.\n"The chief executive officer is personally accountable for compliance," the first source said. This means ensuring rules are not breached is not only in the interests of the firm, but also a question of self-preservation for the CEO.\nIn the Robert Fleming Asset Management (RFAM) probe, RFAM\'s former chief executive Robert Thomas accepted he "bore ultimate responsibility for the compliance failures...". As a result Thomas had his registration with IMRO ended.\nIn order to prevent the kind of dealing that Armstrong was engaged in, adequate separation between front and back offices, where the deals are struck and where they are processed, and strict rules on the use of personal accounts are critical.\nMarket sources noted similarities with Barings, where one of the main criticisms was that Nick Leeson, the trader who stacked up the losses which led to its collapse, was responsible not only for executing trades but settling or matching them as well.\nThis made it unlikely that any discrepancies in his trading would be uncovered in the back office, the sort of loophole regulators such as IMRO look for when they inspect firms.\nInsiders said the Jardine Fleming outcome was a good result for the British watchdog, which came under fire for its handling of previous cases. "If you find a major problem you tell them. If it\'s a serious problem you tell them immediately, you certainly wouldn\'t sit on it," said one.\nAnd while the incidence of breaches may appear to be on the rise, it can be argued that the trend shows the net is tightening. But even the best systems will not prevent mistakes.\n"Even the best of us make mistakes. If you are a large firm problems do arise, if you find them then you take remedial action. There will always be fools, crooks and incompetents," the first compliance source said.\n($1=.6420 Pound)\n'

a(S'Members of the Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G) at Tradeteam, the distribution arm of the brewing operation of Britain\'s Bass Plc, are to vote on strike action over proposed pay cuts, the union said on Friday.\nThe union said in a statement that the ballot of more than 1,000 workers at Tradeteam would start on December 9 and the result would be known on December 20.\nBass said there was no threat to the delivery of drinks to its customers in the run up to the busy Christmas period.\nThe T&amp;G said the ballot was going ahead after an attempt by Tradeteam, a joint venture between Bass and NFC, to have it halted by a legal injunction failed on Friday.\n"Since Bass established Tradeteam in a joint venture with Exel Logistics, management has been trying to cut wages by 100 stg per week and impose inferior working conditions in order to save 10 million stg a year," the union said.\nIt said Tradeteam had also rejected T&amp;G attempts to establish national bargaining. The T&amp;G said a Liverpool judge had refused to grant an injunction to stop the ballot.\n"Bass Brewers Ltd is a very profitable company, which made over 157 million pounds profit over the last year. Their aim at Tradeteam has been to cut the wages of draymen and warehouse workers, many of whom have given over 20 years\' loyal service to the company," T&amp;G national secretary for the drinks industry Brian Revell said.\nDraymen deliver beer and other drinks to pubs.\n"I am pleased that the judge refused the injunction. We are prepared for a long battle with Bass until it honours its responsibilities," he added.\nA spokesman for Tradeteam, which is 50.1 percent owned by NFC, denied a trade dispute existed with the union.\n"There is no trade dispute with the T&amp;G. Current settlements on pay and conditions between Tradeteam and its staff represented by the T&amp;G have been made with full agreement of the T&amp;G at local branch level," he told Reuters.\n"To agree to national wage agreements would mean Tradeteam would be totally out of step with the rest of the industry."\nHe said the union had been involved throughout the consultation process. This had resulted in the current terms and conditions for staff at each of the local offices at which the T&amp;G was represented, he added.\nBass Brewers said the decision to vote on strike action would not affect beer deliveries over Christmas.\n"Obviously the strike issue is one for Tradeteam but we want to reassure customers this will not affect their beer deliveries during or before the Christmas period," Stewart Cain of Bass Brewers told Reuters.\nEarlier this week brewer-to-leisure group Bass, the parent company, said it planned to spend 670 million pounds on the business next year, creating some 7,000 jobs.\nIt said it planned a 300 million pounds investment programme over the next year on its Bass Taverns, converting many pubs to branded concept bars.\n'

a(S'Former Barings executive Ron Baker plans to bring a counter-claim in a lawsuit against him by Dutch bank ING Barings for repayment of a loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.\n"He (Baker) plans to bring in his own counter-claim into those proceedings and they will be heard together unless some sort of arrangement is reached beforehand," Lindsay Hill, a partner at London law firm Fox Williams said.\nING Barings last month confirmed it was suing Baker for 113,000 pounds ($185,800), representing a 100,000 pound loan allegedly given to Baker when he was at Barings, plus interest.\nBritish merchant bank Barings collapsed in February 1995 amid losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. It was rescued by ING which formed ING Barings as its investment banking arm.\nLeeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank\'s downfall.\nBut the saga looks set to run on for some time, with writs filed by administrators of the bank against the former auditors and subsequent third party proceedings being issued against former bosses, including Baker.\nHill said Baker would contest the ING Barings case against him and his counter-claim would be for an unpaid bonus.\n"He believes that the monies that he was promised by way of bonus remain due and are outstanding so yes, they will come into the equation in terms of resolving the dispute with ING Barings," Hill said.\nBaker would not be the first to attempt to force ING Barings to pay a bonus which had apparently been promised before the collapse of Barings itself and ING\'s takeover.\nBut Hill said the decision by a London industrial tribunal on Thursday to reject a claim by another former Barings executive for an allegedly unpaid bonus had no implications for Baker\'s case.\n"It\'s a different case, it\'s for different sums of money and the circumstances are not the same," Hill said.\nMary Walz, who was global head of equity financial products at Barings Investment Bank, had her 500,000 pound claim, which she said she was told was "set in stone" by her former Barings bosses, thrown out by the tribunal.\nHill declined to say how much Baker\'s counter-claim would be for but said the sum was "substantial".\n'

a(S'The debt restructuring package hammered out between Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel and its creditors may not be able to withstand any extra financial demands resulting from last month\'s fire, secondary debt trading firm Klesch &amp; Co said on Thursday.\n"The recent fire onboard a Eurotunnel HGV shuttle has now raised fundamental safety concerns, with potentially dire (but as yet unquantifiable) long-term implications," Klesch &amp; Co said in a report on the restructuring plans.  \nIt said from an investment viewpoint the events "call into question the likely adequacy of the financial restructuring package as currently proposed" but acknowledged the immediate impact on Eurotunnel\'s revenues "is likely to be minor."\nThe report said that according to its calculations, the multi-billion pound debt restructuring hammered out between Eurotunnel and a group of 225 creditor banks, which was finally agreed in October, had only left the company with "headroom," or contingency reserve, of 600 million pounds ($990.7 million), or around 67 million pounds a year over nine years.  \n"Any development (such as the fire) which has the potential to impact future revenues or operating efficiency, could threaten the suffciency of a financial restructuring package."\nPassenger car shuttle services resumed through the tunnel on Tuesday, three weeks after the fire closed the undersea link. The fire on a truck destroyed a freight vehicle and damaged a section of the tunnel. Thirty-four people were injured.  \nRail services for passengers between Paris and London and Brussels and London resumed last week but no date has been set for a resumption of the shuttle service for trucks.\nThe report said that in the aftermath of the fire the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority would have to consider the design and operation of the open-lattice freight carriers.\n"Should (it) decide that fundamental changes will be required to the HGV shuttles, the potential for a reduction in revenues and/or increases in costs could reduce the contingency made available by the restructuring," it added.\nKlesch &amp; Co also pointed out the fire had highlighted that Eurotunnel "consists in its entirety of a single, high profile, effectively irreplaceable, hugely expensive and vulnerable operating asset," a factor at the core of its concerns.\n'

a(S'Following a bumper year in 1996, yet more British companies are likely to be takeover targets in 1997, but much of the merger and acquisition activity will be in the form of agreed deals, corporate financiers say.\n"We certainly see the first quarter of next year being very active. There are a lot of transactions in the pipeline, a lot of activity," Rupert Faure Walker, head of corporate finance at HSBC Samuel Montagu, told Reuters.\nBritain is still regarded as the European leader for takeover activity. "The markets here have always been more open than elsewhere, with not many constraints to other companies coming over here," another senior corporate financier said.\nIn the first nine months of 1996, 278 British companies valued at 14.4 billion pounds ($23.99 billion) were sold in cross-border deals, compared to 258 firms worth 19.1 billion pounds in the same period a year earlier.\nFaure Walker said most of the deals in the pipeline were agreed rather than contested, with a number of strategic mergers reflecting industry rationalisations and cost eliminations. Others said consolidation and deconsolidation would both be driving forces behind activity in the year ahead.\nELECTION TO SET BUSINESS TEMPO\nBut while the outlook for the first quarter of the year looks promising for the corporate financiers who earn their fees by advising either acquirer or target, political influences are likely to colour how the market progresses, with the result of the impending general election the major force at work.\n"The big thing next year is the election," said Faure Walker, adding that the election of a new goverment was likely to introduce a note of caution into the market.\nThis view was backed by the second corporate financier who said there could be some slowing of activity ahead of the election as companies did their best to avoid a deal being straddled across an election period.\nBritain\'s opposition Labour party has consistently been ahead of the ruling Conservatives in the opinion polls and an election is due to be called by May.\nIf Labour wins, companies could take some time to adjust to the new environment and could wait until after a first Labour budget before making any significant moves. For a typical large acquisition this could result a 6-9 month period of caution, some industry players said, although others said activity was likely to continue whatever the government.\nTAKEOVERS TO TAKE IN MORE SECTORS\nA broader spread of takeovers, evident during 1996, is expected to run into 1997 as companies play "catch-up" after a period of caution following the recession of the early 1990s. Formerly publicly-owned utilities, including the few remaining regional electricity suppliers, will be joined by insurance brokers struggling with declining rates and a host of others.\n"The inevitable reconstruction of industries will continue. The pace will quicken," the second corporate financier said.\nThe tendency towards agreed deals also reflected the fact that Britain\'s Office of Fair Trading had largely referred contested deals to the department of trade and industry (DTI) in recent months rather than agreed bids, financiers said.\nREMAINING RECS SET TO FALL\nIn the electricity sector, the remaining privatised regional electricity companies (RECs) are viewed as likely targets for U.S. predators. Southern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity are tipped to follow recent takeover targets Northern Electric and London Electricity into U.S. hands.\nWith only two RECs remaining, some analysts suggest attention will now turn to the water companies, with further takeovers among them.\nSMALLER FINANCIAL PLAYERS TO FEEL THE PINCH\nThe financial services sector is also seen as a hot-bed for further takeovers with perennials such as merchant banks Schroders, Hambros, and Robert Fleming all possible targets for larger global investment banks.\nFurther consolidation among small, specialist City of London and regional boutiques is also likely and Britain\'s dwindling club of large mutually-owned building societies could also attract attention from larger groups.\nIn the insurance sector Commercial Union is seen as a likely bid target or merger partner after widespread rumours suggesting talks with the financial services arm of B.A.T. It has also been linked with General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange.\nAmong the insurance brokers, talk of consolidation as firms try to cut costs in the face of declining rates and overcapacity has been fuelled by recent mergers such as Lloyd Thompson and JIB. Willis Corroon and Sedgwick have long been rumoured to be possible merger or takeover candidates.\nTELECOMS TO RING IN MORE CHANGES\nCorporate financiers see the telecommunications and media sectors as providing significant merger activity during 1997, with Vodafone, cable group Telewest and Orange all tipped as possible targets.\nThere have also been suggestions that Mercury One-2-One may join Mercury Communications and that British Telecom may buy out its 40 percent partner in Cellnet. Energis, the cable company owned by National Grid, has been valued by some at 600 million pounds, while privately-owned Ionica also has long-term plans to float.\nAmong media companies, HTV, Yorkshire Tyne Tees and STV have all been suggested as possible targets, with Pearson an outside contender. In the growing sector of publicly quoted football clubs, Manchester United has obvious appeal.\nOIL AND GAS TO REMAIN IGNITED\nThe demerger of British Gas into separate trading and transport firms in February has led to widespread market speculation that an oil major could be interested in buying the trading arm, to be called Centrica.\nWorldwide consolidation in the oil industry is seen also affecting British firms. Smaller exploration and production firms might be eyed by the big players, all cash-rich after years of cost-cutting and keen to boost oil and gas reserves.\nOther firms tipped to face takeover attempts are DIY retailer Wickes, defence to electronics group Racal, auto-components group T&amp;N, construction group Costain and Imperial Tobacco. Energy, currently part of Hanson but due to be demerged next year, is not expected to be left uncourted for long.\nBritain\'s drink companies are entering a period of steady, organic growth which precludes any major acquisitions. But Allied Domecq, Grand Met and Guinness have been dissuaded from pursuing the idea of demergers.\nThe major food companies are also looking to prune their brand portfolios to allow a more concentrated marketing push behind core brands with international appeal. This strategy will involve disposal programmes and small bolt-on acquisitions.\nBass and Guinness, Associated British Foods and Tate &amp; Lyle are all sufficiently cash-rich to launch sizeable takeovers.\n'

a(S'Britain\'s Takeover Panel, after battling to defend its policing role of London\'s busy mergers and acquisitions market against European interference, has ended the year in the spotlight over its handling of CE Electric\'s bid for Northern Electric.\nThe non-statutory body has spent much of 1996 campaigning against a framework European Union proposal on takeover bids which it says will lead to multi-million pound lawsuits and harm London\'s system of takeover regulation.\nBut on Monday the panel\'s own role was under scrutiny as the outcome of a bitter bid battle between U.S. group CE and British utility Northern hung in the balance.\n"What is going on at the moment is being watched pretty closely. It is a fairly unique situation," a financial services lawyer said.\nCriticism of the part the panel has played stems from a 250,000 pound ($418,600) payment made by Northern to one of its advisors, BZW, the investment banking arm of British banking giant Barclays Plc.\nBZW said this was a discretionary fee and denied that it was linked to its purchase last week of Northern shares, which had already been allowed by the panel. After it was told of the payment, the panel extended the deadline for acceptances.\nAfter the official close of the offer last Friday, Northern would have remained independent as CE had only achieved the support of 49.77 percent of Northern shareholders. But following the extension, CE said on Monday it had 50.13 percent.\nA source close to the discussions said it was "very unusual and maybe unique" for the panel to be in the position of deciding the fate of a company in this way.\nThis view was echoed by other market participants.\n"This is an unndented step the panel has taken," one investment banking source told Reuters of the decision to grant an extension to the offer period at such a late stage.\nNorthern\'s fate now lies in the panel\'s hands. The company has said it wants to appeal against the decision and revert to the result at the original end of the offer period. Acceptances after the initial deadline require the panel\'s approval.\n"They (the panel) now find themselves in a very difficult situation," the investment banking source added.\nAny changes in the way in which the panel operates must either come from government, by bringing in legislation to establish a statutory force to regulate takeovers, or from within the body itself, market players said.\nPressure from industry participants could lead to the panel making changes itself. "They can change the "Blue Book" (the rule book regulating takeovers) at the drop of a hat," one industry source said, adding that it had so far managed the system well.\n"The panel seemed to be coping well with the upturn in bid activity. The system seemed to be working pretty well," he said. Mergers and acquisitions activity has reached peak levels in recent weeks, with a number of both agreed and disputed bids.\nApart from the potential threat from the European takeover directive, there had "been no major challenges to the panel\'s authority over the year", he added.\nEven if the ruling Conservative Party loses a general election which must be held by next May, market participants said they did not expect pressure for legislation to put the panel on a statutory footing under a Labour government.\n"The general feeling is pretty much against it (legislation) and the indications so far ist change it," said one.\n'

a(S'CE Electric, the U.S. energy group, appeared poised to win its hostile bid for British regional electricity group Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday after Britain\'s Takeover Panel ruled against the target firm.\nLate on Monday night the British company lost an appeal to the panel, which polices London\'s mergers and acquisitions market, to reverse an extension of the offer period for CE\'s 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid to 1300 GMT on Tuesday.\nOn Monday morning CE, which is controlled by CalEnergy Co Inc, said it had received acceptances totalling just over the 50 percent mark needed for victory. The offer was meant to close last Friday but was extended after an appeal by CE.\nThis extension was granted because CE raised concerns about the purchase of Northern Electric shares last week by its advisers British merchant bank Schroders and BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW but not declared until Friday.\nIn its statement the panel said it had only been informed of the payment early on Friday but that while "neither element of the fee arrangement was dependent upon the success or failure of the offer", it was "material information which ought to have been made known to the executive" earlier in the week.\nNorthern in turn launched its own appeal against the extension of the deadline because at the time of the first deadline, CE had only gathered support totalling 49.77 percent and therefore fell short of the total needed to win.\nBut after a day of uncertainty on Monday, the panel said its appeal committee had "unanimously dismissed" Northern\'s appeal, that the latest time for acceptance of CE\'s offer should be extended and "any valid acceptances and withdrawals received by the latter time should be taken into account".\nThe panel also said the non-disclosure "may have had market consequences affecting the outcome of the bid, bearing in mind the narrow margin between success and failure in this case".\nCE officials were not immediately available for comment but Northern, which has fought off CE\'s approach from the beginning claiming it undervalued the company, refused to throw in the towel and urged shareholders who had indicated they would accept CE\'s 650 pence per share offer to think again.\n"It is now up to the market to decide. If shareholders do not wish this bid to succeed they should deliver withdrawals of acceptances to the Royal Bank of Scotland by 1300 on Tuesday," a spokesman for Northern Electric told Reuters after the ruling.\nThe spokesman said that in the event of the CE bid lapsing, Northern was willing to "attempt to reach agreement with CE Electric or any other bidder on the true value of the company".\nBy agreeing to effectively "collapse" a rule which says a bidder cannot come back and bid for the same company within a 12 month-period, the spokesman said Northern was opening the way for shareholders to withdraw their acceptances and reopen the debate about the value of the company.\nBZW, which as a result of not declaring the discretionary fee from Northern at the appropriate time will not now be paid this part, said it had done nothing wrong.\n"BZW has at all times acted in good faith and has risked its own capital in support of Northern\'s defence. Our fee arrangement was in no way contingent upon the purchase of Northern shares and the panel has permitted this purchase to stand," a spokesman for the firm told Reuters.\nThis is not the first time such uncertainty has surrounded Northern\'s future since it was privatised along with its 11 regional electricity company (REC) peers in 1990.\nIn 1994 it was the first of the cash-rich RECs to face a takeover and successfully fought off -- partly with the help of an extraordinary 560 million pound defence package -- a bid by conglomerate Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway\'s Kvaerner ASA.\nIf CE\'s bid goes through only two of the original RECs will remain independent, Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric.  \n"It is now up to the market," Northern said, calling for shareholders to withdraw their shares from CE\'s offer by 1300 GMT on Tuesday, the deadline for the hostile bid.\n"In the event that this bid lapses, the board is willing...to enter into discussions with CE Electric, or any other party, with a view to reaching agreement on an improved offer for Northern Electric," the utility said in a statement.\nOn Monday morning, CE said it had received acceptances totalling just over the 50 percent needed for victory.\nCE\'s offer had been due to end on Friday, when it had only gathered support totalling 49.77 percent of the total. However, the Takeover Panel extended the deadline after CE appealed, questioning the purchase of Northern Electric shares by its advisers, Schroders and BZW, and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW.\n($1=.5973 Pound)\n'

a(S'Increased confidence means a third of British companies expect to raise property holdings over the next six months, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and property consultants Grimley.\n"Business confidence has strengthened markedly compared with six months ago and companies expect a further pick-up in business, led by domestic demand," said Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic analysis at the CBI.\n"With profitability set to grow faster over the next six months, the upturn in the commercial property market is becoming more firmly based," he added.\nThe six-monthly survey, which canvassed 645 private sector firms across the range of sectors and regions in Britain, found 32 percent of companies expect to increase property holdings, 26 percent see a reduction and 41 percent do not envisage a change.\n"We expect a steady improvement rather than a dramatic surge in property requirements. The net balance on this survey is plus six percent over the next six months," Stuart Morley, Grimley\'s head of research, said at a briefing on the survey. This, he said was the highest result of the five surveys so far.\nThe report singled out the distribution, metal manufacturing and chemical processing, transport and communications sectors as those likely to see the largest increases in property holdings while over the last six months the largest increases have been in the retail sector.\nLarger companies are most likely to increase their property holdings, reversing a declining trend over the last six months. This, said Morley, could mark the end of the large-scale restructurings which such companies have been undergoing.\n"Large companies have gone through a period of restructuring. This suggests that period has come to an end. They are now looking to expand their holdings," he said.\nMorley said companies were also "noticeably more optimistic about employment prospects than they were in previous surveys", adding this was "now feeding through into increased property demand", and rents were rising fastest in the retail sector.\nRetail was most active in terms of change of holdings and the survey said this should continue. "Not only did this sector see the largest net increase in property holdings over the past six months, it is also expecting the largest net increase."\nAreas where growth in demand for property is expected to be greatest are the north west of the country, followed by Northern Ireland, Greater London and Scotland while holdings are expected to fall at a greater rate in the south east,\nTown centres, with government encouragement, have become more attractive with 50 percent of the extra retail space in these areas rather than out-of-town.\n"This shows a gradual realisation that government policies are beginning to bite, a gradual realisation of the encouragement towards town centres where more companies will be looking for space," Morley said.\nDemand for office space is particularly strong in town centres, although the largest companies are still seeking out-of-town floorspace.\nAccording to the survey the main reason for companies to spend capital on property over the next six months "is the need to expand capacity" ahead of spending to replace property or to increase efficiency.\nThe main constraints companies see to capital expenditure on property are inadequate net returns, difficulty in disposing of property and a shortage of suitable property, the survey found.\n'

a(S'Hunting so-called "fat cats" - the biggest company boardroom earners - may have become a British media obsession but the pay packets of the country\'s top players are under even closer scrutiny from institutional shareholders.\nThe latest row, between electronics giant General Electric Co and some of its major shareholders who objected to a 10 million pound ($15.61 million) five-year package for new managing director George Simpson, resulted in GEC setting tougher performance targets.\nBut questions remain over how much the individuals charged with running some of Britain\'s most, and in some cases least, successful companies deserve to be paid and have led to a reappraisal of the fundamentals of corporate governance.\nBoth last year\'s Greenbury committee on executive pay and the earlier Cadbury report on corporate governance laid down guidelines on how companies should behave. But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line.\nThis has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds.\n"Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should," Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters.\nSkipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company\'s performance justifies the benefit.\nThis means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company\'s performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects.\n"It\'s good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way," one industry insider told Reuters.\nLast week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job.\nMelville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors\' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry.\nA row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation.\nLast year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas.\n"That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors\' pay)," Norwich Union\'s Skipper said.\nThe Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies "have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers".\nSkipper maintains that revealing directors\' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. "It should be there for shareholder scrutiny," she said.\nBut her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions.\nHis mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company\'s annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.\n($1=.6406 Pound)\n'

a(S'After several shaky starts, Britain\'s commercial property market looks set to build on some improvement during 1996, but property experts stress there will not be a return to the sort of boom seen during the 1980s.\n"This is the "Real Thing\'. That is the growing opinion among investors when they consider the recovery now underway in the UK real estate market," said David Hutchings of property consultants Healey &amp; Baker in his 1997 outlook.\nHutchings predicts real rental growth of three percent in 1997 and possible total returns of 15-17 percent for institutional quality portfolios. This should outstrip the return on gilts and may surpass equity returns too, he adds.\nBut uncertainty ahead of a general election, which must be held by the end of May, means a "gradual but sustained upturn" is more likely than a market boom, he said.\nImproved signs of demand, particularly for office space in central London and retail developments, especially shopping centres, have raised expectations. "The feeling is generally that this year is going to be a good one," a senior property analyst at another leading firm of advisors told Reuters.\nThis view is supported by a recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and property consultants Grimley which was also cautiously bullish. It found increased business confidence meant a third of British firms expect to raise property holdings over the next six months.\nThe six-monthly survey, which canvassed 645 private sector firms across the range of sectors and regions in Britain, found 32 percent of companies expect to increase property holdings, 26 percent see a reduction and 41 envisage no change.\nNO DRAMATIC SURGE IN DEMAND\n"We expect a steady improvement rather than a dramatic surge in property requirements. The net balance on this survey is plus six percent over the next six months," Stuart Morley, Grimley\'s head of research, said last week.\nSudhir Junankar of the CBI said firms expect a further pick-up in business, led by domestic demand. "With profitability set to grow faster over the next six months, the upturn in the commercial property market is becoming more firmly based."\nThe CBI/Grimley survey predicts such growth will be strongest in the northwest of England, followed by Northern Ireland, Greater London and Scotland.\nLarger companies are expected to lead the charge with those involved in distribution, transport and communications citing expanding capacity as the main spur in giving the go-ahead to capital expenditure on property.\nThe survey found smaller firms, as well as those involved in metal manufacturing, chemical processing, finance and business services, said that increasing efficiency was the main factor influencing plans for investment in property.\nINTERESTED INVESTORS\nBut companies seeking additional or new space are not the only ones likely to fuel demand for real estate during 1997. Hutchings said the recovery underway in the property market is supported by both occupational and investment demand, in contrast to a brief upsurge during 1993.\nProperty consultant Knight Frank predicts that prime investment yields will be little changed in December from their levels in December 1996.\nIt forecasts the yield on City of London offices will be unchanged at 5.5 percent, while yields on offices in the area around London\'s M25 motorway and provincial towns will rise from 6.25 percent to 6.5 percent and from 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent respectively. In addition to offices, investors and property companies are particularly keen on shopping centres. "The prospects for the retail sector are good," the second analyst said.\nHutchings also forsees higher rents during the year ahead, fuelled by a growing economy, a shortage of top quality supply and low interest rates. Although some occupiers will hang back until after the election, occupational demand means rents will rise "at least until new development comes forward".\nSome development has already begun and Hutchings says there are now growing signs "that institutional funds will re-enter the speculative development market in 1997" although bank lending for such schemes remains tight.\nThis is not the case for other projects where bank loans are more readily available and competition to lend for quality developments has led to wafer-thin margins being charged by some banks, particularly German lenders.\nLONDON LEADS THE WAY\nWhile the number of cranes over the City of London -- London\'s traditional financial heartland -- has not mushroomed, development activity has begun to pick up and more can be expected over the next 12 months, market players said.\nIn London one very visible factor is the heated rivalry that has emerged between the City and Docklands, the former docks area to the east of the capital which is home to the Canary Wharf tower, London\'s tallest building.\nFirms such as U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch and Britain\'s Robert Fleming have still to decide on where to relocate, with others such as Close Brothers and Cazenove also rumoured to be in the hunt.\nAnd in the retail sector, last year\'s sale of former fashion mecca Carnaby Street by Dutch property fund Wereldehave for 90 million pounds "is a testament to the strength of investors\' faith in the London market", said Hutchings.\n'

a(S'Even if British media and leisure group Pearson decides to sell its interest in merchant banking group Lazards, the bank would not be under immediate threat from larger rivals, banking sources said on Monday.\nMarjorie Scardino\'s accession last week as Pearson chief executive has prompted widespread talk that Pearson would sell its 50 percent in Lazard Partners, which owns the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York.\nBut a pre-emption agreement in cross-shareholdings between Lazards and Pearson would ensure the partnership has first refusal on its own shares if Pearson decides to sell its stake, thus preventing the family-run merchant bank from falling into the hands of larger and expanding international rivals.\n"This (speculation) is prompted by the fact that Pearson has a new chief executive who will obviously want to review things," one senior corporate financier told Reuters, adding that the pre-emption agreement meant Lazards "either stays with Pearson or comes within the Lazard empire fully".\nOfficials at both Pearson and Lazard Brothers in London declined to comment on talk of a possible sale.\nPearson has a 50 percent stake in London\'s Lazard Brothers and smaller nine percent stakes in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s.\nAnalysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson\'s main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain.\n"It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson)," the senior financier added.\nPearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its "close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995".\nIt highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a "great partner" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications.\nThe Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares.\nThe Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson\'s holding.\nThe newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson\'s Lazard stake.\nAlthough Lazards\'s stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and "not to a party which could be hostile", David-Weill told the paper.\nWhile Scardino\'s role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill.\nDavid-Weill said last week there was no succession crisis at the bank, adding he still had time. Under the bank\'s statutes, he can remain at the helm for another eight years. ($1=.5974 Pound)\n'

a(S'European privatisations in 1997 could total a record $53 billion, with the telecommunications and utilities sectors expected to dominate activity, U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan said in a report on Monday.\n"Compared with last year, we expect a significantly higher number of IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)...Italy stands out as having the most ambitious (privatisation) programme, at close to $20 billion," said Caroline Meroz, one the survey\'s authors.\nThe report said in the run up to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), European governments "may feel under increasing pressure to accelerate...privatisation programmes to place themselves on track to meet the Maastricht three percent deficit criterion".\nProceeds could be used to reduce government\'s financial debt, although they cannot be taken into account when calculating the deficit.\nIt said proceeds of European privatisations in 1996 totalled a record $43 billion, a 30 percent increase on the previous high in 1994, bringing the total value of the European privatisation programme so far to $230 billion.\nAnd the total estimate for the proceeds of privatisations through to the end of the century could total $118 billion, according to the report, which was based on 53 enterprises which governments have confirmed they plan to privatise.\nMeroz told Reuters that the utility sector had shown the greatest slippage on scheduled privatisations for 1996 with a completion rate of only 20 percent, but that otherwise it had been "a pretty good year".\nThis had been fuelled by strong European equity markets which, excluding Britain, rose by 26 percent over the year and also by "the variety of small innovative deals such as share buy-backs," Meroz said.\nSuch buy-backs could, Meroz said, be used by governments to dispose of residual holdings in companies during 1997.\nThe report said the energy sector accounted for a larger than expected portion of offerings while the privatisations of Deutsche Telekom and Italy\'s ENI "together accounted for 25 percent of 1996 proceeds".\nDemand for future offerings should be well suppored by growing domestic interest and J.P. Morgan forecasts that foreign tranches will be closer to 40 percent than the 50 percent take-up by foreign investors expected in the past.\n"The market has been able to absorb a lot of equities. We think the demand is there," Meroz said, adding there would be strong retail as well as institutional demand.\nSome of the major privatisations planned for 1996 which failed to see the light of day were included in the report\'s 1997 estimates but the rest "may be cancelled (or possibly postponed to much later years) or may be carried out through alternative methods, such as private sales".\nBut a lack of mix of new ideas, both in terms of sectors and the countries the privatisations hail from, could have a dampening effect on the market in 1997, with privatised stocks seldom able to offer the upside of consumer recovery.\n'

a(S'British yachtsman Tony Bullimore\'s survival for four days in the icy Southern Ocean owes much to the high-tech safety equipment available to the modern sailor.\nThis year\'s London International Boat Show was crammed with gadgets such as the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB). It costs 700 pounds ($1,176) but proved its worth by showing Bullimore\'s Australian rescuers where to look for him.\nBullimore\'s ordeal in the upturned hull of his yacht after it capsized in a solo round-the-world race is a far cry from the "Mediterranean marina" which was the centrepiece of this year\'s boat show at Earl\'s Court in west London.\nHuge "Gin Palaces" abound but the show\'s organisers were keen to stress "messing about in boats" is not only for the rich.\nThe smallest vessel on show, the aptly-named Tadpole, was six foot (two metres) long and costs 297 pounds.\nAround 800 boats were on display, 20 of them bobbing gently up and down in a giant indoor marina, built specially for the show, an annual event.\nThe 200,000 visitors had to wear slippers over their shoes to protect the polished decks if they wanted to go on board.\nThe British boating sector has a turnover of some two billion pounds and the boats on show were not just for dreaming about. Orders totalling millions of pounds were placed in the first week of the show, which ended on Sunday.\nTRADITIONAL VERSUS HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT\nThe halls were full of the paraphernalia of boating, with stands displaying traditional brass clocks and barometers competing with the latest in high-tech satellite navigation equipment.\nIf the latest in pump-action lavatories, the smoothest automatic winches or a machine that turns sea-water into drinking water is what you are after, this was the place to be.\nSome firms demonstrated state-of-the-art sail materials, whose development owes much to the space programme. Others showed how traditional wooden "clinker" boat-building still has a place in the late 20th century.\nThe sunnier side of pleasure cruising was to the fore, but, topically, there were also tales of disaster and endeavour.\nAmong the speakers were a couple who 23 years ago spent four months drifting in the Pacific in a tiny inflatable life-raft.\nMotor boats such as the sleek Sunseekers, the latest model of which, the Predator, sells for 1.8 million pounds, dominate one area, but most of the floorspace was dedicated to sailing.\nSAILING REFLECTS BRITISH APPROACH TO THE SEA\nThis, says Tony Beechey, executive chairman of the British Marine Industries Federation, is in keeping with the British approach to the sea and reflects recent Olympic successes.\n"Britons have always been more sail-oriented than power, maybe it is something to do with the climate...but we seem to have a stronger sailboat past," he told Reuters.\nJohn Merricks, who with Ian Walker won a silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics in the 470 dinghy class, says boats need to keep evolving if sailing is to compete with other sports, even if this means his class is dropped after the 2000 games.\n"It\'s harder to draw people into the sport with new outdoor activities competing against it," he said. "We need new, fast, exciting and colourful classes."\nMany visitors made a beeline for the 49-er, recently selected as a new Olympic class and one of a new breed of "skiffs" --lightning-quick sailing dinghies which appear to fly across the water with both helmsman and crew suspended from trapezes.\nThey may cost just over 10,000 pounds, but Martin Wadhams of LDC Racing Sailboats which produces the space-age looking dinghy says fitness, skill and the agility of crews are what counts.\n"The major thing about the boat is it brings the true spirit of the Olympics. It is going to spawn a new era in sailing." ($1=.5950 Pound)\n'

a(S'Beijing\'s top negotiator with rival Taipei sought on Tuesday to allay Taiwan\'s fears that China would swallow up the island if Taipei lifts a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two.\n"We feel this kind of strange logic is very ridiculous," Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, said of Taiwan\'s concerns.\n"We advocate that after reunification, \'you don\'t eat me up and I don\'t eat you up\'," he told reporters in his Beijing office.\nTaiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek\'s nationalist troops lost the civil war to Mao Zedong\'s communist army in 1949 and fled into exile in Taiwan. Taiwan allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries.\nTaiwanese businessmen have poured more than $20 billion into China. Many of them have been clamouring for direct transport links, but Taiwan authorities are reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China.\nTang said scrapping the ban would help both sides and said Taiwan\'s losses would be greater than China\'s in the long run if it resisted direct links.\nChina unilaterally introduced a series of regulations in August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan. China first called on Taiwan to lift the ban 17 years ago.\nThe ban would in effect be scrapped in mid-1997 in any case when the British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, Tang said, adding that Taiwanese aircraft and ships could continue to land and dock in Hong Kong.\nHe said the reunification of China and Taiwan would become a more glaring issue after the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau reverts to Chinese rule in 1999.\n"The Taiwan problem will stand out in front of us after Hong Kong\'s return in 1997 and Macau\'s return in 1999," Tang said.\nTang said time and patience were needed for China and Taiwan to reunify, but declined to spell out a timetable.\n"Time is needed to resolve the Taiwan problem. We have adequate patience," he said, but urged Taiwan not to seek to declare independence. Beijing has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence.\nHe renewed an offer to hold political talks to end almost five decades of animosity. "Political differences must be resolved (through) political talks," Tang said.\nBut Tang said Taiwan must first abandon its attempt to break out of diplomatic isolation.\nBeijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into isolation.\nTies between Beijing and Taipei plunged after the landmark, private visit by Taiwan\'s President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995 that China saw as a move to raise the island\'s international profile.\nChina\'s military conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan before the island\'s first direct presidential elections last March, which Lee won by a landslide.\nLast week, China accused Taiwan of standing in the way of reunification by creating obstacles to economic and trade cooperation, saying the island was "squashing its own feet with a rock" by refusing to end the ban.\n'

a(S'China said on Wednesday Japan was heading for confrontation with an election platform reiterating Tokyo\'s claim to disputed islands in the East China Sea but said it was not too late for Japan to stop its reckless gamble.\n"Japan is turning a deaf ear to warnings and protests from China...and has embarked on the road to confrontation," the official China Daily said, commenting on the election platform of Japan\'s biggest political party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n"It is still not too late for Japan to stop this reckless gamble," the newspaper said in a commentary. "It is high time for Japan to take measures to stop the game for the sake of the world and its own future."\nThe LDP announced last week an election platform that reiterates Tokyo\'s claim to the East China Sea islands, which Tokyo calls the Senkakus and which Beijing and Taipei call the Diaoyus.\n"Japan has not learnt the lesson of its militarist expansion and...it is going into another dangerous game," the newspaper said.\nOn Monday, about 300 Taiwanese and Hong Kong protesters aboard a 50-boat flotilla pierced a Japanese maritime cordon around the islands and briefly raised the flags of Beijing and Taipei on the rocky outcrops in a challenge to Tokyo\'s claim of sovereignty.\nJapan has sought to calm passions in the dispute and asked China and Japan to prevent a recurrence of Monday\'s landings. Tokyo has said it would not recognise a lighthouse built on one of the islands by Japanese rightwingers this year.\nJapanese rightwingers sailed to the islands in July and repaired the lighthouse, rekindling the dispute.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday accused Japan of taking an irresponsibile approach by encouraging landings on the islands by the rightwing groups.\nShen warned that the will of the Chinese people "cannot be bullied" and that sovereignty ranked above everything else.\nThe row was aggravated last week when a Hong Kong activist drowned after diving into stormy seas near the islands as part of a protest against Tokyo\'s sovereignty claim.\nTokyo\'s claim dates back to 1895, when it defeated imperial China and seized the uninhabited islands. Japan says the issue is not open for discussion.\nChina has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries.\nTaiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan, which only recognises Beijing\'s Communist government.\nThe China Daily commentary also slammed the LDP\'s election platform for containing an endorsement of visits by cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine to Japan\'s war dead.\n"Japanese politicians have waged a war to reverse the verdict on Japan\'s war shame concluded by the world half a century ago," the commentary said.\nJapanese prime minister and LDP leader Ryutaro Hashimoto in July broke a decade-long taboo on prime ministerial visits to Tokyo\'s Yasukuni Shrine, saying it was time for Japan to stop apologising for honouring its fallen soldiers.\n"Such dishonest activities, which reinvigorate militarism, have naturally caused indignation in the war-victimised countries," the newspaper commentary said in reference to visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders.\nLast week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang expressed strong indignation over the LDP\'s election platform.\n'

a(S'China\'s propaganda tsars have axed all the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo, among the earliest victims of a crusade to resurrect communist puritanism.\nThe state-owned Hua Yi publishing house decided recently to stop publishing a four-volume collection of Wang\'s 30-odd novels after coming under fire from the Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party, the author said on Friday.\n"Someone reported me to the Propaganda Department. They said my works were reactionary...and ridiculed politics," Wang told Reuters by telephone.\n"They said the taste and the language were vulgar...I do not deny this," said Wang, the author of colloquial novels that depict the underbelly of society in Chinese cities and are peppered with strong language and sex.\nPropaganda tsars forced Hua Yi to write a self-criticism for publishing such politically incorrect books, Wang said.\n"Hua Yi dared not continue publishing my books...No other publication house will dare to publish them," he said.\n"The decision is very regrettable...I hope this is temporary...Not all my books have problems. I hope they will allow publication of some of them."\nThe publishing house and the Propaganda Department could not be reached for comment.\nHua Yi has published about 200,000 copies of the "Collected Works of Wang Shuo" since 1992. Wang earns more than 100,000 yuan ($12,000) a year from reprints of his works, about 20 times the average urban salary.\n"Reprints each year are my major source of income. It will have a big impact on me," Wang said of the ban.\nThe publisher has not been required to recall Wang\'s books, but military-owned bookstores have been banned from selling them.\nPirated copies of Wang\'s works, such as "I\'m Your Father" and "Life Fast, Die Happy", have reportedly now appeared.\nWang is the most prominent victim so far of the Communist Party\'s crusade to resurrect what it calls spiritual civilisation, communist jargon for toeing the party line that has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.\nThe Communist Party elite ended a four-day, annual closed-door plenum in Beijing on Thursday with a pledge to "use outstanding works that inspire people to cultivate citizens of a socialist (society) with ideals, morals, culture and discipline".\nChinese film censors have been dragging their feet on giving approval to the public showing of the movie "Dad", said Wang, who directed and wrote the script for the film and wrote the extremely popular television series "Stories from the Newsroom".\n"Basically, it\'s done for," Wang said of his movie, which was completed late last year. A private film company spent 3.3 million yuan ($398,000) on the film.\nShooting of "Relations between Man and Woman" was halted in April because the movie had "mistakes and too much description of sex", said Wang, who wrote the script.\nThe spiritual civilisation campaign has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss and the number of movies shot so far this year has plunged to about 30 compared with an annual average of 160 in the past, a Chinese source said.\nEight movies shot by the state-owned Beijing Film Studio had met the same fate as Wang\'s films, the source said.\n"People don\'t know what kind of movies can be approved," said the source who asked not to be identified.\nAsked if he was repentant, Wang said: "I only have two roads to take. The first is to change my style and write things the government can tolerate and encourage. The second is to do nothing.\n"It\'s very hard to write things the government likes...I will need two to three years to adjust," he said.\n'

a(S'China\'s Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin appears to be making all the right moves to shore up his position to retain power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, diplomats and analysts said on Friday.\nJiang has declared war on corruption, crime and poverty -- scourges that have plagued China for centuries and led to the downfall of many a dynasty.\nIn his latest move, he used the party\'s four-day, annual closed-door plenum that ended in Beijing on Thursday to resurrect ideological puritanism -- spiritual civilisation -- which has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.\nWhether Jiang would be able to stave off challenges from rivals in the party and cling to power in the post-Deng era hinged in part on the crucial 15th party congress to be held in late 1997, diplomats and analysts said.\nThe party\'s political heavyweights will be jockeying for position in the run-up to next year\'s congress, a five-yearly opportunity for reshuffles in the party\'s powerful Politburo and its yet more influential standing committee.\nChinese sources say the Communist Party is debating a plan to revive the post of chairman and to create one or two vice chairman positions -- one of which could be given to Premier Li Peng, a loose ally of Jiang whose term ends in 1998.\nLi is required by the constitution to step down as premier in 1998 after serving two six-year terms and is keen to find another job to remain in the top echelons of power.\nArmed with the weapon of spiritual civilisation -- communist jargon for toeing the party line -- Jiang is battling to avoid the fate of his two predecessors, analysts said.\nHu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were sacked from the party\'s general secretary post in 1987 and 1989 respectively because their "grip on material civilisation was tight but their grip on spiritual civilisation was loose", one Chinese analyst said.\n"They did not pay enough attention to ensuring that the party\'s position could not be challenged...that was what brought them down," an Asian diplomat said of Hu and Zhao.\nA plenum communique attested to Jiang\'s worries. "From the start to the end, we should be resolute on tightening the grip on both," the plenum communique said.\n"At no time can we sacrifice spiritual values in the name of momentary economic development," the communique said.\nThe spiritual civilisation campaign aims to create a communist utopia -- stamp out superstition, tighten the party\'s grip on media, instil politically correct values and create heroes and model workers whose orthodox Marxist behaviour the populace at large should strive to emulate.\nIt is hardly rousing stuff. But Jiang may be desperate.\nAnalysts said Jiang remained overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented economic reforms and still influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health.\n"In the midst of his great triumph, Jiang Zemin if he is all that powerful...there is no need for him to go out of his way to mention Deng Xiaoping," a Western diplomat said referring to the communique that tips its hat to Deng.\n"Jiang Zemin...is still in consolidation mode...in the process of selling himself," he said. "The jury is still out."\nJiang is eager to consolidate his power base even after amassing the three most important positions in China -- general secretary of the Communist Party, state president and chairman of party\'s powerful Central Military Commission.\nMany diplomats see Jiang as a transitional figure after the death of Deng, which is widely expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world\'s most populous nation.\n'

It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\n'

a(S'China\'s flamboyant tycoon Mou Qizhong is hounded by creditors, faces lawsuits and investigation for alleged irregularities and cannot leave the country, company officials said.\nThe embattled chairman of the Land Economic Group, who has been identified by local media as China\'s second richest man, was down but not out and was counting on Russian-made satellites to bail him out of financial trouble, they said.\n"We\'re in a crisis," Chen Fang, spokeswoman for Mou, told Reuters late on Monday. Mou declined repeated requests for an interview.\nDomestic creditors had demanded repayment of loans, group officials said. Mou\'s Land Economic Group owes 200 million yuan ($24.1 million) at home and another 200 million yuan in Hong Kong and Russia.\n"Some creditors...have asked for their money back even before the maturity date," Chen said, adding that the company was planning to repay the loans gradually.\nDomestic banks had refused to grant Mou new loans and the group had given up seeking loans from Chinese banks. "Abruptly recalling loans could be fatal," Chen said in an interview.\nAt least one investor had demanded its money back, but agreed to convert its equity into a loan, company officials said.\n"The major problem we\'re facing now is circulating funds getting cut off... As a result, many projects are held up," Chen said.\nGovernment authorities had cleared Mou of suspicion of tax evasion and of using unlawful funds but he remained under investigation for other unspecified irregularities, company officials said.\nThe authorities had been dragging their feet on renewing his passport apparently out of fear that he may flee the country and join his wife and three sons in the United States. Mou hopes to visit the United States next month.\nSalaries of employees were slashed to 270 yuan a month -- China\'s urban minimum wage -- in July and August and were 600 yuan in September from an average of 2,000 yuan a month in the past, the officials said. About 50 people have resigned, leaving some 300.\nA contractor in Inner Mongolia had sued the Land Group for allegedly defaulting on a contract, and court officials foreclosed on company cars and office equipment in August.\n"Many people say that this could be what is called in Buddhism an inexorable doom for Mr Mou or the Land Group," Chen said.\nChen blamed the woes of Mou on the media "surrounding and attacking" him since March as well as a smear campaign by former employees and a government credit squeeze to curb inflation.\n"But the Land Group will not collapse," she said.\nMou plans to raise an unspecified amount of money through a planned share issue, for two Russian-made GALS communications satellites he owns, on the Hong Kong stock exchange, officials said.\nThe first was launched in January 1994 and the second in November 1995. Russia launched both satellites in Kazakhstan.\nIn addition, Mou has bought a 30 percent stake in a company that will develop, manufacture and launch two Russian-made Intersputnik communications satellites.\nThe first of the two satellites is due to be launched from Kazakhstan in late 1998.\nThe satellites were expected to bring Mou net profits of $500 million and bail him out of his current crisis, Chen said.\nThe group has assets worth 1.2 billion yuan and liabilities of just 400 million yuan.\nIt is not Mou\'s first crisis. He was sentenced to death but eluded execution in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution for criticising chairman Mao Zedong.\nMou was released from prison in 1979 and established his company the following year. He was arrested again and jailed for one year on a charge of speculating in the early 1980s.\nHe ran up huge debts in the mid 1980s but managed to bounce back by importing small refrigerators from South Korea at low tariff rates, raking in millions of yuan.\n'

a(S'China sent a senior official to attend a reception at the Ukraine embassy on Friday despite a diplomatic rift over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan\'s vice president Lien Chan.\nBut an apparent guest list mix-up left both sides unsure over who would represent Beijing at the reception, held to mark Ukraine\'s independence day.\nUkraine\'s ambassador thought Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei would attend, but the Chinese thought it was Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang.\nZhang, however, fell ill and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan showed up instead.\nThe confusion followed Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan\'s three-day trip this week to Ukraine which infuriated Beijing.\n"It was a misunderstanding...a mix-up," Ukrainian Minister-Counsellor Leonid Leshchenko told Reuters, referring to the guest list.\nAsked if he saw it as an intentional slap on the wrist, Leshchenko shook his head and said: "No, no no."\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry protocol officer said Tian, the vice-minister that the Ukrainians were expecting, was abroad.\nUkrainian diplomats noted that Tang, the vice-minister who attended, was filling in for Tian as the acting first vice-minister and was actually higher in rank than the person who fell ill.\nUkraine\'s Ambassador Anatoly Plyushko emerged from a half-hour chat with Vice-Minister Tang, and said the vice-minister told him that China attached "great attention to bilateral relations" and "hoped to continue to develop" ties.\nPlyushko said the vice-minister did not raise the issue of Lien\'s three-day Kiev visit.\n"All Chinese guests...invited came," Plyushko said. "This is evidence...(of) their attitude towards our relations. I\'m optimistic."\nThe atmosphere was less pleasant on Wednesday when the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned Plyushko to protest against Lien\'s trip.\nChina regards Taiwan as a rebel province with no right to conduct foreign relations on its own, and has sought to push it into diplomatic isolation since a civil war separated them in 1949.\nThe former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China but not Taiwan.\nIn apparent retaliation against Lien\'s visit, Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has postponed a visit to Ukraine.\nIn Kiev, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko took a shot at Beijing on Thursday, saying China had over-reacted to Lien\'s visit and calling Beijing\'s protest "out of proportion".\n'

a(S'A son-in-law of China\'s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has resigned as director of the armament department of the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), Chinese sources with close ties to the military said on Sunday.\nMajor General He Ping, husband of Deng\'s youngest daughter Deng Rong, quit the post recently after his hopes for promotion were dashed, one source said.\n"He Ping was unhappy... He wanted to become deputy chief of general staff, but the Central Military Commission would only make him assistant chief of general staff initially," the source, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.\nThe assistant chief of general staff is one rank below the deputy chief of general staff.\nAnother source said a replacement had been named to succeed He Ping as director of the armament department, which supplies equipment to the three million-strong PLA.\nThe commission\'s refusal to give Deng\'s son-in-law the post he wanted was not so much a blow to the first family as it was a boost to the position of Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin.\n"It was not so much as a challenge to Deng Xiaoping. Rather, it was a sign that Jiang Zemin is now more powerful," the second source said.\nThe first source agreed. "Jiang Zemin does not have to do everything Deng Xiaoping says," the source said of the commission\'s decision not to promote He Ping to deputy chief of general staff.\nJiang, who is chairman of the commission, has moved in recent years to shore up his position by appointing allies to key military positions and shrug off Deng\'s shadow.\nDeng, 92, no longer holds any office but remains highly influential. He has not been seen in public since early 1994.\nThe paramount leader vouched for his son-in-law, whose company was alleged to have been involved in the smuggling of the biggest haul of automatic weapons in U.S. history.\n"Deng Xiaoping spoke. He said: \'It was not He Ping\'s fault\'... He Ping does not have any more problems," the first source said of the arms smuggling scandal.\n"It was a trap by the United States," the source said of the arms seizure. Many communist officials harbour deep suspicions of the United States and the view that the arms seizure was a U.S. conspiracy to undermine China.\nChina\'s two top government-run arms merchants, Polytechnologies Ltd and China North Industries Corp (Norinco), have rejected U.S. charges they were involved in the scandal.\nHe Ping is president of Poly Group, which is owned by the PLA\'s armament department. Poly Group subsidiary Polytechnologies is a joint venture with China\'s flagship multinational China International Trust and Investment Co and headed by Wang Jun, son of a late vice-president and close associate of Deng.\nNorinco is a civilian organisation that has no direct relationship with the army but supplies it with arms.\nIn March, U.S. federal agents seized a shipment of 2,000 AK-47 fully automatic machine guns and 4,000 ammunition magazines, with a street value of more than $4 million.\nU.S. agents arrested at least seven people, including executives of Norinco, in May and charged them with involvement in the ring.\nThe seizure was the culmination of a 16-month investigation of senior officials, based in both the United States and China, of Norinco and Polytechnologies.\nThe suspects had offered to sell much more powerful weapons to undercover agents, including mortars, rocket launchers, machineguns and a surface-to-air missile, U.S. officials have said.\n'

a(S'China\'s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, reported to be in fragile health, was absent from a rally on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and other survivors of the 1934-36 Long March.\nDeng, 92, one of about 700 surviving veterans of the Red Army who trekked 9,650 km (6,000 miles) across China on foot to flee Chiang Kai-shek\'s Nationalist troops, did not appear on state television which showed the 45-minute rally live.\nDeng, who no longer holds any office but is believed to remain highly influential, has not been seen in public since early 1994.\nHis health is a matter of intense speculation in China, Hong Kong and the Asian region because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as de facto emperor of the world\'s most populous nation.\nThe official line is that Deng is in good health for a man of his age.\nExtensive preparations were made last year for Deng to grace official celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the World War Two victory against Japan, but his scheduled appearance was cancelled at the last minute, Chinese sources said.\nThe Long March rally was seen by some analysts as a show of support for Deng\'s successor, Communist Party boss and state president Jiang Zemin, who has been eager to shrug off the patriarch\'s shadow.\n"It was staged to show Jiang has the support of military from the old to the present and future generations," one Chinese analyst said.\nLong March survivors, including former state president and Jiang\'s bitter rival Yang Shangkun, were at the rally. A representative of the three million-strong People\'s Liberation Army pledged to follow Jiang\'s leadership.\nEight Young Pioneers -- China\'s version of boy and girl scouts -- recited poems at the rally at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing adjacent to Tiananmen Square.\nWearing his trademark army uniform with no stars or stripes, Jiang urged the ruling Communist Party to inherit the spirit of the Long March.\n"The spirit of the Long March...is a strong spiritual force that guarantees our walking from victory to victory," Jiang said, reading from a prepared statement.\nThe gruelling Long March slashed the Red Army\'s numbers to about 7,000 from 100,000, but survivors were hardened and went on to defeat and drive Chiang and his troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\n"The road after the revolution is even longer and the work greater and tougher," Jiang said.\nJiang has declared war on crime, corruption and poverty -- problems plaguing China today -- and embarked on a crusade to resurrect socialist ethics, which have been eroded by almost two decades of economic reforms.\nHe paid little tribute to his mentor, mentioning Deng only twice in his lengthy speech.\nThe People\'s Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, splashed on its front page a photograph showing portraits of Jiang, Deng and chairman Mao Zedong hanging over a cultural performance on Monday evening to mark the anniversary.\n'

a(S'China on Tuesday slammed Taiwan for failing to crack down on a new opposition party seeking independence for the island and warned that separatism was "a road to death".\n"Not only do the Taiwan authorities fail to ban the formation of the Taiwan Independence Party, but they also tolerate it," a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, said.\n"The self-proclaimed anti-independence stand of the Taiwan authorities is a double-faced practice that deceives others as well as themselves," the official People\'s Daily quoted the spokesman as saying.\nBeijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since Mao Zedong\'s Red Army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek\'s Nationalist troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nA group of Taiwanese activists plan to break away from Taiwan\'s main opposition party and form the Taiwan Independence Party on December 12.\nChina has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence. China conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan last March in the run-up to the island\'s first direct presidential elections to cow Taipei into abandoning any dreams of independence.\n"Taiwan independence is a road to death that cannot be walked because it is blocked," the spokesman said.\nThe spokesman described the party as a "reactional political organisation" with the explicit purpose of splitting the motherland.\n"The Taiwan authorities should adopt realistic anti-independence action as soon as possible. Compatriots on the two sides are waiting to see," the spokesman said.\n"The Chinese government and the Chinese people will definitely not sit back idly and do nothing about it," the spokesman warned.\n"Their scheme will never succeed," he said of the new party\'s drive for independence.\nTaiwan says it is committed to reunification, but stresses that this cannot be achieved overnight and says China must democratise.\nBeijing\'s criticism came a day after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui blamed China for deadlocked relations between the two.\nReferring to the Communist authorities, Lee said in a speech on Monday: "They adopted a hegemonic attitude and stubborn policy toward Taiwan, singlehandedly blocked the development of history and caused the stalemate of cross-Strait relations."\nThe island maintains an official policy of anti-independence, but has decriminalised advocacy of independence, saying such calls are within the bounds of freedom of speech.\nTies between Beijing and Taipei, which began to thaw in the late 1980s, took an icy plunge after a landmark, private visit by Lee to the United States in June 1995.\nChina, which has sought to push Taiwan into diplomatic isolation, saw the trip as a bid to raise the island\'s international profile.\nBeijing has stepped up its reunification overture in recent months, calling for political talks to end almost five decades of hostility.\nChina unilaterally introduced a series of regulations last August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan.\nTaiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949, but allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries. Taiwan is reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China.\n'

a(S'China demanded on Monday that the United States cancel plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other weapons to Taiwan to prevent "new damage" to slowly recovering Sino-U.S. relations.\n"We ask the U.S. side...to cancel plans to sell missiles to Taiwan to prevent creating new damage to Sino-U.S. relations," a Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters.\nBeijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since the end of the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.\nThe United States should take Sino-U.S. relations into account and live up to its promise regarding the sale of weapons to Taiwan, the spokesman said without elaborating. Washington has agreed to reduce weapons sales to Taiwan.\nRejecting a similar demand by China on August 15, the U.S. Defence Department notified Congress last Friday of plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other weapons to Taiwan.\nU.S. officials said the weapons were defensive and the sale would not affect the basic military balance in the region.\nThe Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy 1,299 Stinger missiles, 74 guided missile launchers, 74 flight trainer Stinger missiles, 96 jeep-like Humvee vehicles and 500 rounds of .50 calibre ammunition for an estimated $420 million.\nThe principal contractors are the Hughes Missile Systems Co., Boeing Missile and Space Systems Co. and AM General.\nSuch sales must be made through the U.S. Defence Department, not directly by contractors, and Congress must be notified in case it wants to veto the sale.\nSino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing.\nThe ties plunged to new depths over the last year in a row over a landmark trip by Taiwan\'s President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995.\nEarlier this month, Beijing warned Washington that a U.S. stopover by Taiwan\'s Vice-President Lien Chan could cause new damage to slowly recovering ties.\nHowever, in a sign that China was eager to prevent Lien\'s visit from harming slowly warming relations, Beijing refrained from further comment while Lien was in the United States.\nTies between Beijing and Washington were set on better footing after a visit to Beijing by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in July.\nThe trip laid the groundwork for an exchange of high-level visits later in the year, with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher invited to China in November and Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian due to go to Washington before the end of December.\nAn exchange of visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton could go ahead next year, if Clinton wins re-election in November.\nChinese officials have said they expect Christopher\'s visit, his first since a 1994 trip that stumbled badly over human rights, to go smoothly with both sides keen to remove obstacles in their relations.\nIn a separate development that could strain Sino-U.S. ties, the Washington Post reported on Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Pakistan was secretly building a medium-range missile factory near Islamabad using Chinese blueprints and equipment.\nAsked to comment on the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said: "The report is totally groundless."\n'

a(S'China said on Friday that Taiwan was a pawn and toy of hostile Western forces out to weaken and divide the country and thwart its development.\n"Taiwan...acts as a pawn of international anti-Chinese forces, a toy in the hands of others," said a front-page commentary in the People\'s Daily, the ruling Communist Party\'s official newspaper.\nThe commentary, issued to mark the 25th anniversary of Beijing\'s ousting of Taipei from the United Nations, accused Taiwan of collaborating with forces hostile towards China to try to regain admission to the world body.\n"Some Western forces have ceaselessly played the \'human rights card\', \'Tibet card\' to limit China\'s development," the commentary said.\n"They see the Taiwan issue as one of their trump cards -- an important means of weakening and dividing China," it said without naming any countries but implying the United States.\nIn September, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a non-binding resolution supporting Taiwan\'s efforts to rejoin the United Nations, enraging Beijing.\nChina, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, maintains that the issue was settled once and for all in 1971 when Taipei was replaced by Beijing at the United Nations.\nThe commentary said countries that have helped Taiwan with its bid to regain admission to the United Nations were shortsighted like "rats which can only see an inch in front of their eyes".\nIt urged Taiwan\'s allies, mainly Central American, African and Caribbean countries, to stop "foolish activities in the interest of others".\nFor the fourth consecutive year, China and its supporters blocked moves in the General Assembly in September to consider U.N. membership for wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan.\nChina considers any move to give Taiwan U.N. membership an encroachment on its sovereignty and an interference in its internal affairs.\nBeijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since Mao Zedong\'s Red Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek\'s Nationalists and forced them to flee to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nBeijing\'s communist rulers have sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation to force it into reunification. Almost 160 countries recognise Beijing, while 30 have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\nBoth communist Beijing and capitalist Taipei agree to reunify one day, albeit on different terms. China has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.\nThe commentary said Taiwan\'s offer to give $1.0 billion to the United Nations on admission into the world body had become an "international joke".\nIt jeered at the argument that Taiwan deserved a seat as it was now democratic and economically prosperous, saying the island was "deceiving others and itself".\n"No matter what political system Taiwan implemented or what level of economic development it attained...regaining admission to the United Nations would be purely a dream," it said.\n'

"Admittance to the courtroom is often denied to ... journalists and other \'outsiders\' on grounds that the courtroom is \'too small\'," Human Rights Watch said.\nWang\'s court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year\'s trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China\'s tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nWang\'s mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister have been allowed to sit in.\nThe court has refused to give details of Wang\'s trial other than the fact that he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government, but one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People\'s Court if convicted.\nWang\'s mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, though she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.\nHuman Rights Watch was not optimistic about an acquittal. "He has not had adequate time to prepare a defence," it said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.\n"Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence," the group said.\nWang\'s family have found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has in recent months cracked down on its tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been imprisoned.\n'

a(S'Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan is to step down in a long-delayed reshuffle after the downfall of his mentor, the Chinese capital\'s disgraced Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, sources with close ties to the city government said on Sunday.\nLi, 58, mayor of Beijing since 1993, would become a vice-minister of labour and could eventually replace Li Boyong, 62, as labour minister, said the sources who asked not to be identified. The two Lis are not related.\nLi Qiyan\'s departure was widely expected after one of his vice-mayors came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide in April 1995.\nThe suicide shocked the nation and led to the downfall of Li\'s mentor, Chen Xitong, who has since disappeared from the public eye.\nChen resigned as Beijing\'s Communist Party boss and was later sacked from the Politburo, becoming the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949.\nOfficials say Chen was himself still under investigation for possible wrongdoing.\nThe city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen\'s disgrace, the sources said.\n"After Chen Xitong stepped down, the (city) government lost its credibility ... and could maintain only the most basic operation," one source told Reuters. "It could not embark on huge projects ... It could not do anything."\nLi would be replaced by Jia Qinglin, 56, party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian, the sources said.\nJia arrived in Beijing last week to take up his new post as acting mayor, the sources said. Jia is expected to formally become the capital\'s mayor after his nomination is approved by the Beijing People\'s Congress.\nIn the run-up to the party\'s 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to Beijing\'s Communist Party secretary and land a seat in the party\'s powerful Politburo, they said.\nThe vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus which threatened the party. Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.\nEarlier this month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang, former head of two publicly listed Hong Kong affiliates of a China steel giant, and two former officials of the Beijing city government.\nThe announcement of the charges against Zhou was among the first against one of China\'s so-called "princelings", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.\nZhou, detained in February, 1995, is the son of Zhou Guanwu, former chairman and Communist Party secretary of Beijing\'s giant Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, also known as Shougang, and among the largest conglomerates in China.\n'

The two men have the same surname but are not related.\nDiplomats and Chinese sources said Li was forced to step down because of his close links to Chen, who resigned as Beijing party boss in April 1995 after his protege, a vice-mayor, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide.\n"Li Qiyan had been closely associated with Chen Xitong...and Li Qiyan\'s departure was inevitable," a Western diplomat said.\n"When revelations about the extent of corruption in the Beijing government became public, sweeping changes of the Beijing leadership were required but could not be done in one go in the interest of preserving stability," the diplomat said.\nChinese sources said the city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen\'s downfall and that authorities had decided they could no longer delay naming a new mayor.\nChen was sacked from the party\'s powerful Politburo in September 1995, the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949.\nHe has since disappeared from public view and has come under investigation for possible wrongdoing.\nIt was not known if Li was under investigation.\nXinhua said the Beijing People\'s Congress, or city council, had approved the appointment of Jia Qinglin, 56, as vice and acting mayor of the nation\'s capital.\nThe Central Committee of the Communist Party named Jia to the post of vice secretary of Beijing\'s party committee.\nJia had resigned as party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian and was replaced by Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi, Xinhua said.\nFujian Vice-Governor He Guoqiang would replace Chen as the provincial governor, it said.\nIn the run-up to the party\'s 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to chief of the Beijing municipal party committee and even land a seat in the Politburo, Chinese sources have said.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nWang Baosen, the vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city.

a(S'China began the trial of prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan on Wednesday on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a court official said.\n"The trial started at 9.00 a.m. (0100 GMT)," said an official of the Beijing People\'s Intermediate Court reached by telephone. He declined to give further details.\nSecurity was tight around the court building in western Beijing, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building and manning roadblocks to prevent access.\nThe father of the former student leader protested his son\'s innocence just hours before the start of the proceedings and said the family would not give in to the authorities.\n"He is definitely innocent," Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home with the dissident\'s mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court. "It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not."\nWang\'s mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.\n"I\'m not optimistic about the results," Wang Xianzeng said. "We will definitely appeal... We will not give in.\n"Speech can\'t overthrow the government," he said.\nThe court indictment against Wang, 27, includes the charge that his writings in foreign publications were evidence of his plot to try to overthrow the government.\nHe is also accused of accepting foreign funds, of colluding with subversives living overseas and of conspiring with domestic plotters to organise the overthrow of the government.\nWang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.\nThe former student leader faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.\nThe mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.\nShe said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days.

a(S'China called on Taiwan on Tuesday to show goodwill by lifting a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links, saying attempts by the island nation to block such links would be futile.\n"Obstructing the three links between the two sides...will be futile...is against the will of the people on both sides," a commentary by the Xinhua news agency said of Taiwan\'s ban on direct trade, transport and mail links with China.\n"(We) hope the Taiwan authorities can make a pragmatic, goodwill response," said the commentary carried by major newspapers on Tuesday.\nLast week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links.\nTaiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since Mao Zedong\'s communist army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek\'s Nationalist troops to the island at the end of a civil war in 1949.\nIndirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s through Hong Kong or a third country.\nThe commentary accused the Taiwan authorities of creating obstacles to direct trade and transport links in recent years, saying this would not be conducive to prospects for peaceful reunification. The commentary did not explain how it would not be conducive.\nChina regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has threatened to invade if the island declared independence. It has also sought to push Taipei into diplomatic isolation.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, clamour for direct trade and transport links, but Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nTaiwan says it is committed to reunification but stresses this cannot be achieved overnight.\nLast week China heaped pressure on Taiwan by offering to hold political talks to end almost five decades of hostility.\nNearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians were scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday for a a high-profile, 12-day visit, despite reservations voiced by the island\'s leaders about depending too heavily on China.\nThe visit has aroused attention because the delegation is led by Kao Ching-yuan, a senior member of Taiwan\'s ruling Nationalist Party and vice-chairman of President Enterprises, the island\'s biggest investor in China.\nTaiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials.\nThe trip comes less than two weeks after Taiwan\'s President Lee Teng-hui called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding over dependence on the mainland.\nThe China Times Express newspaper in Taipei said on Sunday that Taiwan\'s economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorate.\nThe Taiwanese delegation would be the largest to visit China since easing tensions across the Taiwan Strait began to fray in mid-1995 over a landmark, private visit by Taiwan\'s President Lee to the United States.\nIn apparent retaliation, China denounced Lee and held intimidatory war games off Taiwan before the island\'s historic presidential elections in March in which Lee was re-elected.\n'

a(S'Chinese dissident Wang Dan has appealed against his 11-year jail sentence for plotting to subvert the government, but his mother said on Tuesday she held little hope of an acquittal or a lighter sentence.\nWang Lingyun said she hoped U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and German President Roman Herzog would raise her son\'s predicament in their meetings with Chinese leaders when they visit China later this month.\n"Wang Dan... should be acquitted because... he\'s innocent," she told Reuters by telephone. "We hope for an acquittal or a reduced sentence... but it is unlikely."\nWang Lingyun, who acted as one of two defence lawyers in her son\'s case, said court officials had asked her to submit a written defence for the appeal and that family members may not be allowed to attend the appeals court trial.\nExperts on China\'s legal system have said the chances of the appeals court overturning the lower court\'s verdict were slim.\nAn official of the Beijing Higher People\'s Court said the 27-year-old dissident had filed his appeal. She declined to provide further details.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People\'s Court took less than four hours last Wednesday to convict and sentence Wang, who had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nOn Monday, visiting Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his disapproval to Chinese Premier Li Peng over the jailing of Wang.\nA foreign ministry spokesman defended China at a news briefing on Tuesday, saying Beijing would not impose its laws on others and that foreign countries should take a similar stance.\nThe spokesman also said China opposed using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of any country.\nAn international human rights group denounced what it said was the "secret trial" of Wang on a trumped-up charge.\n"What (the court) brought to bear on Wang Dan was a secret trial in which the facts were deliberately hidden and the truth distorted," the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.\n"A fabricated charge was used to wantonly convict Wang Dan," the group said. "Wang Dan\'s case... is suppression and persecution of thought and speech by the Chinese government."\nWhen told during the trial of his right to seek the removal of any biased judges, Wang demanded all judges and prosecutors be removed from the case. The tribunal rejected his request after a few minutes of deliberation, the group said.\nChina said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.\nThe group said more than 10 people wearing tags identifying themselves as reporters attended the trial but there was no mention of the conviction in the local Chinese-language media.\nThe jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China\'s struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.\nHuman Rights in China accused the official Xinhua news agency of preparing English-language stories about the results of the trial and an interview with the chief judge even before the verdict was delivered.\nAsked to comment, an official of the foreign affairs office of Xinhua said: "It is not necessary to find out whether the story was prepared before or after the sentencing... News agencies have different ways and practices of releasing news."\nAfter breaking the news of Wang\'s conviction, it took Xinhua only 1-1/2 hours to put out a 54-paragraph story on the interview with the chief judge.\n'

a(S'Leading Chinese dissident Chen Ziming has been placed under tight police surveillance after his release on medical parole and needs permission to consult a doctor, a relative said on Thursday.\n"Some conditions (after his parole) are not as good as when (he) was in prison," the dissident\'s sister, Chen Zihua, said after meeting him earlier on Thursday at his home.\n"When he was in prison he could still go downstairs for some air," she said in a telephone interview. "(Now) he can\'t even go downstairs to get some sun... He cannot go out."\nChen Ziming has been under tight police surveillance since he was released on medical parole and returned to his eighth-floor Beijing home late on Wednesday.\nAsked about Chen\'s plans, the sister said he did not talk about anything besides his wish to get medical treatment.\nThe dissident needs police permission to see a doctor, the sister said. He has heart, liver and digestion problems. He had been treated for cancer.\nHe is barred from talking to foreign reporters. Uniformed and plainclothes police on Thursday prevented reporters from approaching Chen\'s home and that of his parents.\nAsked if the dissident was under house arrest, Chen\'s sister said: "(I\'m) afraid it\'s a little graver than that. It\'s just moving the prison from one place to another."\nBut his release was a welcome surprise to the family.\n"We felt surprised to a certain degree. Of course, (we) are happy (he) could be released," the sister said. "His medical parole...was a little unexpected."\nChen, 44, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991 for engaging in "counter-revolutionary", or subversive, activities during a student-led campaign for democracy that was centred on Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square in 1989.\nChen had been singled out by Beijing authorities as the "black hand" behind-the-scenes organiser of the demonstrations, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.\nHe won medical parole in 1994 in a move widely seen as part of a successful bid by Beijing to persuade Washington not to revoke China\'s Most Favoured Nation trade status on grounds of persistent human rights violations.\nChen was returned to prison on June 25, 1995, after joining calls for Beijing to release political prisoners and reverse its verdict that the Tiananmen Square protests were seditious.\nHis release on Wednesday came seven days after a Beijing court took less than four hours to convict former student leader Wang Dan and sentence him to 11 years in prison for plotting to subvert the government.\nWang\'s imprisonment was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China\'s embattled dissidents, most of whom were already either in exile or serving long terms in administrative detention or prison.\nAsked if Chen\'s release was a gift to U.S. President Bill Clinton on his re-election, the sister said: "It gives (Clinton) face."\nHuman rights have long been a major irritant in Sino-U.S. ties already strained by disputes over trade, copyright piracy, arms proliferation and Taiwan.\nU.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to travel to Beijing this month for a visit widely seen as a vital step toward rebuilding the cross-Pacific relationship.\n'

a(S'China announced on Saturday a massive restructuring of one of its biggest conglomerates after reportedly meting out a suspended death sentence to the son of the former company chairman, one of the country\'s ruling elite.\nState media announced the restructuring of Capital Iron, or Shougang, on Saturday but made no mention of the suspended death sentence handed down to Zhou Beifang, the former head of two of the steel giant\'s Hong Kong-listed affiliates.\nA Beijing court gave Zhou the suspended death sentence for corruption as part of China\'s highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched last year, a Chinese source said on Saturday.\nThe sentence was the heaviest handed down in recent years to one of China\'s so-called "princelings", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.\nShougang, one of China\'s biggest conglomerates, was thrust into the limelight after Zhou\'s detention in February 1995.\nThe arrest of a man symbolising Beijing\'s efforts to wield capitalist influence while retaining a socialist veneer underlined the vulnerability of that system to nepotism and abuse.\nZhou Beifang\'s father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age following his son\'s detention.\nThe Zhous have close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nLast month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang and two former officials of the Beijing city government. No other details of the case were available.\nChinese courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases. Suspended death sentences are often commuted to life imprisonment after two years.\nCourt officials could not be reached for comment on the sentencing.\nThe China Daily said the restructuring of Shougang draws a clear line between the property rights, responsibility and management of the parent company and subsidiary.\nIn the past, a large percentage of the parent company\'s profits went to branch companies, many of which are running in the red, the newspaper said.\nShougang\'s parent company would gradually cut off financial subsidies to subsidiaries which would be forced to sink or swim in the market economy as part of the restructuring programme.\n"We will provide financial support for our subsidiaries for a few years, helping them in investment, finance and discharge of their debts based on an appraisal of their fixed assets," Bi Qun, Communist Party secretary of Shougang, told the newspaper.\n"Once that is done the subsidiary companies will develop strategies to stop losing money and begin to make profits," Bi was quoted as saying.\nThe number of employees of the parent company would be gradually slashed to 58,000, or one-fourth of the group\'s total, the Xinhua news agency said. It gave no timetable.\nThe group\'s 27 subsidiaries would employ 176,000 people.\nThe group registered 1.653 billion yuan ($199 million) in pre-tax profits in the first 10 months of 1996, Xinhua said. It gave no comparative figures.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.\n'

a(S'Two Chinese magazines are struggling for survival after being targeted in a crusade by China\'s propaganda tsars to cleanse the media of liberal influences, Chinese sources said.\n"Focus" magazine in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen has suspended publication for two issues after a Hong Kong newspaper reported the magazine defied propaganda tsars and ran a cover story on the anniversary of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the sources said.\nThe Propaganda Department of the Communist Party had frowned on any commemoration of the decade of turmoil unleashed by revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to purge political rivals and infuse the nation with renewed ideological vigour.\nA writer for the magazine said the suspension was due to a Hong Kong newspaper report of the article\'s publication.\n"Had it not been for the foreign report, the magazine would not have suffered this kind of setback," said the writers, peaking anonymously "This was a kind of punishment...by the party."\nIn a telephone interview, Li Mei, publisher of Focus, disputed this assessment, saying the suspension was linked to unrelated financial trouble.\nOther Chinese sources said the problems at "Focus" stemmed from the Communist Party\'s clampdown on publications and authors who dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.\n"If a publication takes a detour (from the party line), it will be suspended for restructuring. There will be no exceptions," one source quoted propaganda tsars as saying.\nPropaganda tsars are also debating the fate of the Beijing-based magazine "Orient" for publishing a series of book reviews on the "Collected Works of Gu Zhun", sources said.\nThe Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party had ordered a gag on all debate on the thoughts of Gu, an independent thinker who angered Beijing before his death during the Cultural Revolution.\nGu openly opposed totalitarianism and supported the rule of law and civil rights.\nThe fifth edition of the magazine was published in September under the watchful eyes of censors, the sources said.\n"We will still be able to publish the sixth edition. After that we don\'t know," a magazine editor, who asked not to be named, said in an interview.\n"They did not say what exactly the problem was with the magazine," said the editor who suggested that politics could be the cause.\nThe axe has fallen on other publications, authors and filmmakers.\nIn August, the Press and Publications Administration suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in the southwestern province of Guizhou.\nThe suspension followed the magazine\'s publication of an article critical of a privately circulated tract known as the "10,000-word essay" that urges a return to class struggle and warns of the erosion of the state sector by private enterprise.\nIn September, Cui Enqing was sacked as president of the Beijing Youth Daily after the Chinese capital\'s most outspoken newspaper reported a poisoning case that caused a plunge in sales of a state-owned beverage manufacturer.\nPropaganda tsars also have banned all of the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo.\nThe campaign to enforce ideological orthodoxy has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss as to what kind of movies would receive the blessings of propaganda tsars. The number of movies made this year has fallen sharply compared with previous years.\n'

a(S'China\'s former first lady Wang Guangmei auctioned her private antique collection on Tuesday and said she would use proceeds to help impoverished mothers.\nWang\'s collection, consisting of porcelain bowls and plates and a brush holder made of ivory dating back to the Qing (1644-1911) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, fetched 566,000 yuan ($68,000) at an auction at a Beijing hotel.\n"My mother gave them to me ... They are priceless to me," Wang told Reuters.\nShe is the widow of former president Liu Shaoqi who died in prison during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nThe Sungari auction house had put the value of the antiques, some of which were Wang\'s dowry from her wealthy capitalist father, at up to 510,000 yuan ($61,000).\nThe collection was seized from Wang and eluded destruction by radical Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The authorities returned some of her collection when she was released from prison 11 years later.\n"They were at Zhongnanhai or they would have all been smashed during the Cultural Revolution," Wang said. The Zhongnanhai compound in central Beijing still serves as home and office to many of China\'s leaders.\nLiu, China\'s former president, was deposed during the Cultural Revolution and died in prison in 1969. He was rehabilitated posthumously in 1980.\nWang said she had deep emotional ties to the collection but these were outweighed by concerns for those living in poverty.\n"I would be reluctant to part with what my mother left me without a reason ... (but) my heart aches even more when I see impoverished mothers," the former first lady said.\n"It shouldn\'t be like this. The country led by our Communist Party cannot let families be this destitute," she said.\nChina has about 65 million people still struggling to get by with incomes under the official absolute poverty line of 530 yuan ($64) a year, officials say.\nIn September, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin vowed to "gnaw the hard bone" of poverty by pouring funds into the drive to raise living standards for the poorest segment of the nation by the turn of the century.\nThe communists, who swept to power in 1949 on public resentment against widespread poverty and corruption, fear the widening gap between rich and poor today could spark social unrest and undermine its grip on power.\nChina says it reduced the number of people living in abject poverty by five million in 1995.\nAbout 3,500 destitute mothers in western and southwestern China were expected to benefit from Tuesday\'s auction.\nProceeds would go to an anti-poverty fund headed by the former first lady to lend money to impoverished mothers to help them get started in farming, raise livestock or make handicrafts to earn a living in future, Wang said.\nThe fund would also provide education and give medical treatment to destitute mothers, she said.\n'

a(S'Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island\'s investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded relations.\n"If the relations between the two sides are kept at a low ebb due to political and ideological problems... Taiwanese businessmen will lose confidence because of higher risks," said Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, Taiwan\'s biggest investor in China.\nChinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing earlier told the same seminar in Beijing no one could stand in the way of direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan which have been banned by the island since 1949.\nKao is heading a delegation of nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity.\nKao called for the resumption of talks suspended last year after Taiwan\'s President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.\n"I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment," Kao said.\nTaiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials during the current trip, which comes less than two weeks after President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.\nTaipei\'s China Times Express newspaper said on Sunday that Taiwan\'s economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorated.\nLi, the Chinese vice-premier, took a swipe at President Lee, saying no one could block direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan, rivals from the time of the Chinese civil war that ended in 1949.\n"Economic development between the two sides is the general trend and no single person can obstruct this," Li said.\n"Any person who tries to place artificial barriers to restrict economic cooperation is going against the will of the people of the two sides," he said.\nHe also told the seminar he hoped Taiwan authorities would allow direct links as soon as possible.\nIndirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s, through Hong Kong or a third country.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport links. But Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nChina has been pressing Taiwan to open direct links. Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links.\nThe Taiwanese delegation is the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Taiwan President Lee\'s mid-1995 visit to the United States.\n'

a(S'China\'s exports climbed again in October as slow demand at home encouraged companies to ship abroad and the government expanded credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said Wednesday.\nThe upturn was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet\'s State Planning Commission.\nExports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.9 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said.\n"This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year," Wang said in a telephone interview. Wang said slow domestic demand has forced manufacturers to look to overseas markets.\nAlso, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.\nThe International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.\nExports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency.\nA slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.\nHowever, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.\nImports inched up 3 percent to $11.31 billion in October from October 1995, the Business Daily said.\nThe import data showed that the impact of this year\'s tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, China\'s exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.\nJapan, the United States and Europe remained China\'s largest export markets.\nChina\'s exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.\n'

a(S'China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism in Tibet, saying religion would have to bow to socialism.\nMonks outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings in the Himalayan region, the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Wednesday.\n"In the basic interest of the Tibetan people, further development of temples, monks and nuns cannot be without restrictions," the newspaper said.\n"Satisfying the basic needs of believers will do."\nThere were 1,787 temples in the restive region by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the newspaper said. It gave no comparative figures.\nChina has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to uproot the influence of the region\'s spiritual god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.\nSocialism must take precedence over religion, the newspaper said.\n"Religion must adapt to the development needs of socialism and not socialism adapting to the needs of religion. We must remain clear-headed on this principle," it said.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet\'s holiest man as a Western plot to return the region to feudal rule and split China.\nBeijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.\n"International anti-Chinese forces use the Tibet issue to contain China\'s development and (the Tibet issue) is an important means to \'Westernise\' and \'divide\' China," the newspaper said.\n"Some temples are directly or indirectly controlled by the Dalai Lama clique and become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad," the newspaper said.\n"Since 1987, elements creating disturbances and sabotaging stability have been mainly law-breaking monks and nuns."\nTibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by supporters of the Dalai Lama.\nThe newspaper also complained that monks did not contribute to economic growth.\n"It goes without saying that such a large number of strong young people relying on alms from the masses and not engaging in productive work has a negative effect on social and economic development," the newspaper said.\n"Money spent on renovating temples is more than money spent on building or repairing Communist Party and government buildings," it said.\nBeijing, eager not to antagonise all of the Buddhist clergy, has pumped 53 million yuan ($6.4 million) into its five-year renovation of the sprawling Potala Palace, winter home of the Dalai Lamas for centuries.\n'

The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.\nThe International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.\nExports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency, the renminbi.\nA slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.\nHowever, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.\nImports inched up a year-on-year three percent to $11.31 billion in October, the Business Daily said.\nThe import data showed that the impact of this year\'s tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, China\'s exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe latest figures brought the total trade surplus for the January-to-October period to $12.01 billion, it said.\nJapan, the United States and Europe remained China\'s largest export markets.\nChina\'s exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.\nMachinery and electronic exports totalled $38 billion in the first 10 months, accounting for one-third of total exports and up 11 percent from the year-ago period, the newspaper said.\nExports of toys, furniture, shoes, crude oil and plastic products increased in the first 10 months. But exports of textile yarn and related products, garment, steel and aquatic products all fell, it said.\nImports by foreign-funded enterprises in the first 10 months soared a year-on-year 23 percent to $105.0 billion.\nCar imports plunged 39 percent year-on-year between January and October, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate.\n'

a(S'China announced on Thursday that a court had rejected the appeal by a son of one of the country\'s politically powerful families, upholding a suspended death sentence for bribery.\nThe court showed leniency to Zhou Beifang, 43, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corp (Shougang), because he showed remorse, the official Xinhua news agency said.\nZhou\'s death sentence was suspended for two years. Such suspensions usually mean the sentence will not be carried out if the prisoner repents and cooperates with authorities.\nZhou is one of China\'s so-called "princelings", or children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections.\nThe Zhou family has close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nThe court also showed leniency because Zhou voluntarily returned ill-gotten wealth even before prosecutors obtained evidence against him, Xinhua said.\nZhou was convicted of accepting bribes totalling 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.2 million) between June 1993 and April 1994, Xinhua said. It gave no details of who paid Zhou the bribes or why.\nHe was also found guilty of paying 1.2 million yuan ($144,600) in bribes to three people, including two former officials of the Beijing city government, so that his wife and daughter could move to the British colony, it said.\nXinhua quoted the Supreme Court as announcing the decision though it was the appeals court that handed down the verdict.\nThe agency gave no explanation. It did not say when Zhou was convicted, when he appealed or why his appeal was turned down.\nCourt officials reached by telephone declined comment.\nState television showed a grim Zhou wearing a stylish, striped blue shirt and examining documents held by a court policeman as a court tribunal looked on.\nZhou\'s conviction was part of a highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched by China last year. It led to the suicide of a Beijing vice-mayor in April 1995 and the fall of his mentor, former Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong.\nZhou\'s father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age. He stepped down days after his son\'s detention.\nThe court also rejected the appeal of co-defendant Chen Jian, 39, former deputy director of the General Office of the Communist Party\'s Beijing Municipal Committee. It upheld his 15-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from Zhou, Xinhua said.\nAnother former official of the Beijing city government, Li Min, did not appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment, also for accepting bribes from Zhou, the agency said.\nIn a related case, the court rejected the appeal of businessman He Shiping, who was sentenced to 16 years for accepting bribes. A fifth defendant, who was given five years in prison, did not appeal, it said.\nTelevision showed lengthy footage that include Li staring at the floor and a dejected He Shiping wiping tears from his eyes.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949. But it has staged a comeback since economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago as living standards climb but at the cost of eroding party discipline.\n'

a(S'China will defrock radical monks in Tibet in a crackdown that could last up to five years in a bid to uproot the influence of the Dalai Lama in his Himalayan homeland, a Chinese propaganda official said on Thursday.\n"Lamas who are comparatively reactionary will be told to return to secular life," the propaganda official said by telephone from Tibet\'s capital, Lhasa.\n"Reorganisation of monasteries... will consist mainly of ideological education... It could continue for three to five years," said the official, who declined to identify himself.\nChina has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, Tibet\'s exiled god-king, in the region, saying religion must conform to socialism instead of the other way round.\nAtheist China views religion as feudal superstition though it tolerates a limited degree of religious freedom.\n"Religious culture... not only hampers social development and economic development, but also stops people becoming more civilised," the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.\nThe newspaper complained last week that monks in Tibet outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings.\n"Monasteries will not be closed... (but) work teams will enter and be stationed at monasteries," the propaganda official said.\nFor several months, China has been stationing "work teams" in Tibetan monasteries. The teams force monks into study sessions on becoming more "patriotic" and into signing pledges supporting Chinese authorities.\n"Those aspects of religion which fail to adapt to social development and impede social progress will be eliminated... to prevent the Dalai Lama from using religion to engage in splittist activities," the official said.\nThere were 1,787 temples in Tibet by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the Tibet Daily has said.\nThe newspaper has complained that healthy young Tibetans were entering the clergy and living off alms instead of working.\nChina has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to try to eradicate the influence of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet\'s holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.\nBeijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.\n"The spiritual realm is the main battlefield of our struggle against the Dalai Lama clique," the Tibet Daily said.\nThe newspaper said last week some temples in Tibet were controlled by supporters of the Dalai Lama and had become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad to engage in separatist activities.\nIt blamed monks and nuns for creating disturbances and sabotaging stability since 1987. Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by the Dalai Lama\'s supporters.\n'

a(S'A Chinese court on Friday will consider the appeal of dissident Wang Dan against his 11-year sentence for plotting to overthrow the government, a hearing held days before a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.\nThe Beijing Higher People\'s Court was widely expected to reject the 27-year-old dissident\'s appeal and uphold his conviction, Chinese lawyers said. In China, appellate courts rarely overturn rulings by lower courts.\nAsked what the chances were of an acquittal, Wang\'s mother, Wang Lingyun, told Reuters on Thursday: "I feel there\'s practically none. There is no precedent."\nWang\'s appeal comes four days before the scheduled arrival of the U.S. secretary of state, who diplomats say was expected to raise human rights issues in his meetings with Chinese leaders during his November 19-21 visit.\nSino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a briefing on Thursday that Wang\'s trial had no bearing on Sino-U.S. relations because it involved a Chinese citizen and not an American.\nBeijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\nChristopher would not be not alone in bringing up Beijing\'s shortcomings in human rights.\nFormer British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that harsh sentences slapped on Wang and Wei Jingsheng, widely known as the father of China\'s modern democracy movement, had caused dismay in the international community.\n"The recent harsh sentences imposed on Mr Wei and Mr Wang have caused dismay in the wider world," Thatcher told a business conference in Beijing.\nLast week, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his misgivings over the jailing of Wang to his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng.\nWang\'s mother said court officials had told her that she would be able to attend her son\'s hearing as one of two defence lawyers, but she would not be allowed to speak. She has submitted a written defence.\nThe dissident\'s father and older sister would also be allowed to sit in on the hearing at the appellate court in Beijing, the mother said.\n"If we don\'t go, Wang Dan would feel even more isolated. Our going is spiritual encouragement for him," the mother said.\nThe dissident\'s lawyer is unlikely to attend because only Wang would be allowed to speak.\nThe jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China\'s struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.\nThe lower court took less than four hours to convict and sentence Wang on October 30.\nWang had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life in 1989.\nThe New York-based Human Rights in China has denounced what it said was the "secret trial" of Wang on a trumped up charge.\nChina said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.\nThere has been no mention of Wang\'s conviction in the local Chinese-language media.\n'

It was very unfair," she said. "The (appeals) court just copied the verdict of the first trial."\nThe 27-year-old dissident was not allowed to speak at his appeal hearing as a judge read from a brief, prepared statement, the mother said.\nWang was convicted of plotting to subvert the government by publishing articles in foreign publications and receiving funds from hostile overseas organisations.\nThe mother said she would petition the appeals court but that it would be a formality and would not involve the court holding another trial.\nCourt officials, reached by telephone, declined comment. The tightly-controlled state media made no mention of Wang\'s conviction.\nPolice earlier kept reporters away from the court building, the family\'s home and nearby subway stations.\nThe dissident, wearing a red sweater and grey suit, appeared in low spirits and poor health, the mother said.\n"(But) he was psychologically prepared. It came as no surprise. He does not have any illusions about them (the authorities)," she said.\nThe former student leader had already served four years in prison for his role in student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the army in 1989.\nThe U.S. secretary of state, scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, was likely to bring up human rights when he meets Chinese leaders.\nSino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by issues ranging from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.\nBeijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\nFormer British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said in Beijing on Thursday that the world was dismayed by harsh sentences slapped on Wang and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng, the father of China\'s modern democracy movement.\nThe jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China\'s struggling democracy movement.

a(S'American movies, hamburgers, jeans -- and U.S. bashing -- are all the rage in China today.\nChina and the United States have gone from confrontation in the 1950s and 1960s to odd bedfellows in the 1970s and 1980s to a love-hate relationship in the 1990s.\n"More and more ordinary Chinese people are disgusted with the deeds of the United States," said Tang Zhenyu, one of five authors of "China Can Say No", a controversial bestseller which is capitalising on anti-U.S. sentiment.\nFor Tang, the fondness he once had for the United States ended in March when Washington sent aircraft carrier battle groups to waters near Taiwan where China was conducting war games and missile tests to cow the island into abandoning any dreams of independence.\n"I believe this was the turning point for most ordinary Chinese people," Tang said in a recent interview.\nWashington sent the warships in a show of force to support Taipei, Beijing\'s rival since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, as Taiwan held historic direct presidential elections.\nFor some Chinese, their American dream turned into a nightmare when Beijing lost its bid to host the 2000 Olympics in 1993. Many blamed Uncle Sam.\nAnti-U.S. sentiment mounted after Chinese state media played up what was described as unfair and discriminatory treatment meted out to Chinese Olympians at the Atlanta Games.\n"In the past, the United States had the wrong impression that the Chinese government was anti-U.S. while the people were pro-U.S.," said Wang Jisi, director of the Institute of American Studies of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n"China Can Say No" touched a sympathetic chord with many Chinese fed up with the United States.\nIt has chapters entitled "Burn Hollywood" and "If necessary, create another Saddam" in a reference to Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein.\n"China Can Say No" sold so well that its authors have put out a sequel. It has given rise to a flurry of anti-U.S. books, including "Why Does China Say No?"\nBeijing and Washington have also wrangled over human rights, arms proliferation and trade. The two giants narrowly avoided a bruising trade war in 1995 and again this year over U.S. charges that China condoned copyright piracy.\nMany Chinese welcomed the re-election of U.S. President Bill Clinton this month as the return of a devil they knew and are hoping for a new post-election approach from Washington.\n"Now, a good opportunity has presented itself for improving and expanding Sino-U.S. relations," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said of Clinton\'s re-election.\nU.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to visit China next week to help push that process along. China last week blasted U.S. penalties against textiles ahead of Christopher\'s visit, but said the two sides had more in common than differences.\nThe Sino-U.S. honeymoon began in the 1970s when China\'s bamboo curtain came down and the country opened up to the West, triggering an influx of U.S. pop culture.\nMcDonald\'s is now a household word to many Chinese children and China\'s youth have traded yesterday\'s navy blue Mao suits for today\'s jeans.\nU.S. blockbusters, such as "True Lies" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks\' "Forrest Gump", have taken China by storm, raking in millions.\nBeijing\'s honeymoon with Washington ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Chinese military crackdown on a student-led drive for democracy in June 1989.\nSino-U.S. ties were dealt another jarring blow after the United States allowed a private visit by Taiwan\'s President Lee Teng-hui in June 1995. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into isolation.\nSino-U.S. ties have improved since the March war games but China still suspects Washington is trying to contain it.\n"The United States does not wish for the rise of a strong country which does not listen to it and does not do things according to its rules," said Wang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n'

a(S'A Tibetan nun has had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing\'s choice as the reincarnation of the region\'s second holiest monk, the Tibet Information Network (TIN) said on Monday.\nThe sentence of 19-year-old Ngawang Sangdrol, jailed since she was 15, was doubled in July, partly because she refused to accept Beijing\'s choice as the Panchen Lama, according to the London-based TIN, which monitors human rights in the Himalayan region.\n"Ngawang...is now facing (more time) in jail than any other female political prisoner in Tibet," TIN said. She is due for release in the year 2010.\nOfficials reached by telephone in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa denied knowledge of the report.\nThe 10th Panchen Lama died in 1989, and Beijing has anointed a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation.\nThe Dalai Lama, Tibet\'s exiled spiritual leader, has named another six-year-old boy as the 11th Panchen Lama, and many Tibetans see the Beijing-backed child as a pretender.\nBeijing\'s choice is in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans, Chinese sources have said.\nChina denies there are political prisoners in Tibet and says foreign critics of its human rights record are interfering in its internal affairs.\nNgawang is already serving nine years -- three years for taking part in a pro-independence demonstration in 1992 and six years for singing nationalist songs in prison in 1993, according to TIN.\nHer sentence was doubled in part because she refused to tidy her cell in Lhasa\'s Drapchi prison in March in apparent protest against a political re-education campaign, TIN said.\nThe campaign is designed to force prisoners to accept Beijing\'s choice as the reincarnated Panchen Lama.\nNgawang also refused to stand up in the presence of a Tibetan official, Brigade Commander Khandrol Jangpe, TIN said.\nThe human rights group, which had reported in August that Ngawang was on a restricted diet and confined in a cell with no windows, said it had only recently received confirmation of the longer jail term through a former prisoner who fled Tibet.\nChina has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama in Tibet, saying socialism must take precedence over religion.\nThe Dalai Lama, the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.\nState media have complained that monks and nuns outnumber high school students and that too much money was spent on the region\'s monasteries.\n'

a(S'Chinese activists, in a statement on Tuesday hours ahead of a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, protested against American backing for Japan\'s bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.\n"We hold that Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations," the activists said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is due to arrive in Beijing later on Tuesday for a three-day visit.\nThe letter, signed by 15 activists, said they opposed Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security Council because many Japanese politicians had been reluctant to apologise for its war atrocities and had tried to whitewash history.\nChina says more than 35 million people were killed or wounded during Japan\'s invasion and occupation of most of China from the early 1930s to 1945.\n"(We) strongly protest the U.S. government supporting Japan\'s (bid) to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to draw Japan over to its side," said the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters.\nTong Zeng, a leader of the group, said he would forward the letter to Christopher through the U.S. embassy in Beijing.\nThe Chinese government, eager for more low-interest loans from Japan, has been reluctant to antagonise Tokyo and has not taken a public stance on the issue.\nThe United States has long supported giving Japan and Germany permanent seats on the Security Council.\nThe council currently consists of five permanent members that were the main victors in World War Two -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- and 10 non-permanent members who serve two-year terms.\nMost Chinese have been slow to forgive Japan\'s war past.\n"U.S. backing for Japan\'s (bid)...will undoubtedly encourage the resurrection of Japanese militarism and bring a new threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region," the letter said.\nThe anti-Japanese activists recounted what they said were U.S. mistakes, including not putting Emperor Hirohito on trial after the end of World War Two in 1945.\n"After the end of the war, the United States harmed the feelings of the Chinese people several times...sheltering Japan\'s top war criminal Emperor Hirohito," the letter said. Hirohito died in 1989.\nThe activists also faulted the United States for "ignoring historical facts" and handing disputed islands in the East China Sea to Japan in 1971.\nSino-Japanese ties were strained this year over the islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyus and Tokyo the Senkakus.\nA Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July, triggering anti-Japanese demonstrations in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nTaiwan\'s Nationalist rulers, who lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, also claim the islands. Activists in the British colony of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, have opposed Japan\'s territorial claims.\nEmotions were fanned in September when a Hong Kong activist drowned after he jumped into stormy waters around the islands to demonstrate support for Chinese claims.\n'

a(S'Bankruptcies in China -- unheard of for almost four decades -- are expected to more than double in number this year as authorities try to shed hopelessly indebted firms.\nThe figure is expected to rise even further next year as officials become more determined not to subsidise loss-making state firms.\nMore than 5,200 Chinese companies were expected to go under in 1996, up from 2,200 in 1995 or more than the previous six years put together, Cao Siyuan, architect of China\'s bankruptcy law, said.\n"Whether enterprises are psychologically prepared for it or not, the rate of bankruptcies gradually increasing is unavoidable," Cao said in a recent interview.\nIn the first half of this year, 1,692 enterprises declared bankruptcy, soaring by more than 107 percent compared with the year-ago period, said Cao, who now runs a consultancy to help enterprises seeking to merge or go bankrupt.\nA total of 1,625 firms declared bankruptcy in 1994, up from 710 in 1993, 428 in 1992, 117 in 1991 and 32 in 1990.\nChina passed a breakthrough bankruptcy law in 1988 in the first flush of an ambitious campaign to force lumbering state-owned enterprises to sink or swim in the marketplace.\nHowever, official fears of mass unemployment and social unrest if loss-making firms are allowed to go under has hampered implementation of the bitter medicine.\nBut China was expected to accelerate bankruptcies and mergers of state firms next year to reduce the burden on state coffers and slash subsidies to state enterprises.\nThere is little need for alarm for the ever-increasing number of bankruptcies because it is only a fraction of the total number of enterprises, said Cao.\n"One can\'t say it\'s too big," Cao said of the number of insolvent enterprises. "Currently, the bankruptcy rate is less than 0.1 percent (of the total number of firms)... One percent is normal."\nAbout one percent of China\'s estimated 100,000 state enterprises were hopelessly in debt and completely unattractive to investors looking for cheap companies to purchase or to merge with, Cao said.\nIn Huangshi city in the northern province of Hubei, about 80 percent of medium- and large-size state enterprises are losing money, the official People\'s Daily said.\nChina\'s state sector reported a historic net loss of 3.0 billion yuan ($361.4 million) in the first quarter, the first such deficit since the country embraced paramount leader Deng Xiaoping\'s economic reforms in 1979.\nThe government allocated 20 billion yuan this year to write off bad debts of state firms which go under, but this is hardly enough, the People\'s Daily said.\nIn Wuhu city in the central province of Anhui, 420 million yuan is needed to write off the bad debts of 35 state firms, but only 50 million yuan has been allocated, the newspaper said.\n"Mergers and bankruptcies... are roads without detour," the People\'s Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said.\n"(Enterprises) which should die should be allowed to die," the newspaper said. "Mergers and bankruptcies are a reform in which we have more to gain than lose."\nBut bankruptcies and mergers must guard against social unrest, debt evasion and theft of state assets, it said.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n'

a(S'Two sons of Beijing\'s disgraced Communist Party boss, Chen Xitong, have been detained and face possible prosecution for economic crimes, Chinese sources said on Friday.\nThe fate of Chen himself was unknown. He was one of the most powerful men in China before his fall in April 1995 after one of his proteges, Beijing Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide.\n"It all depends on the (party\'s) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection...(which) is investigating Chen Xitong," one source said in reference to whether the commission would hand Chen\'s case over to courts for prosecution.\nCourt officials, reached by telephone, declined to comment.\n"This is a test of whether the government\'s anti-corruption drive is for real," the source said told Reuters. Critics say the campaign targets only petty officials.\nTwo sources with ties to the party said Chen\'s eldest son, Chen Xiaoxi, and younger son, Chen Xiaotong, were being held at the Qincheng Prison in a northern suburb of Beijing and faced possible prosecution.\nThe younger son has been in custody since last year but it was unclear when the older son was detained.\nThe sources said they were uncertain over precisely what charges might be filed against either of the two.\nPrison guards were transferred to Beijing from other provinces to ensure the two men remained under tight security. Beijing was the political powerbase of the family.\nOutlook magazine, published by the official Xinhua news agency, said this month that Chen Xitong\'s case "will not just fade away".\nChen Xitong, 66, has not been seen in public since April 1995 when he resigned as Beijing\'s Communist Party boss. He was ousted from the party\'s powerful Politburo in September 1995, becoming the most senior victim of a crackdown on corruption.\nChen, who was promoted to the Politburo in recognition of his hardline stand against student-led demonstrations for democracy in Beijing in 1989, is believed to be under virtual house arrest. He is officially said to be under investigation for "serious mistakes".\nUnpublished party documents have said Chen, who ran Beijing for 12 years, first as mayor and then as party boss, had abused his office by amassing $24 million in unauthorised funds and lavishing favours on friends, associates and a mistress.\nChen gave nine flats around Beijing to his mistress and her relatives, according to the documents.\nIn December 1995, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa shed light on Chen\'s whereabouts. Zhang said: "His life is better than mine... He plays table tennis...eats what he wants."\nA second source quoted official documents as saying the younger son illegally channelled government funds to his father\'s mistress, He Ping.\nThe younger son, a former executive of a Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel in Beijing, also tipped off his father\'s mistress about the vice-mayor\'s suicide and told her to go to Hong Kong and not come back, the source said.\nThe brothers are among China\'s so-called "princelings", or children of the ruling party elite who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\n'

a(S'China\'s breakaway Catholic Church has ordained about 50 graduates of one of the country\'s biggest seminaries into the priesthood this year, clergy at the seminary said on Monday.\nThe new priests, five of whom were ordained on Sunday, were the first group of clergymen installed by the National Catholic Seminary since 1991, they said.\nThe officially authorised seminary in Beijing did not accept any new students for six years from 1986 due to a lack of funds and space, the clergymen said.\n"It\'s a big problem. Funds are too limited," a priest surnamed Meng told Reuters by telephone.\nThe seminary receives 10,000 yuan ($1,200) a year from the government, or one-sixth of its annual budget, another priest said. It raises the rest from donations.\nFather Meng, who graduated in 1991, said there was no shortage of youths, many of them poor, who wanted to become priests.\nHe and other priests denied that government pressure had played a role in the lack of new students between 1986 and 1991.\nCatholics in communist China are allowed to worship openly only if they belong to the state-sponsored Catholic Patriotic Association.\nThe association, which supervises the national seminary, appoints its own bishops and does not recognise the Pope as universal Catholic leader.\nThe official church has the blessings of the Communist Party but it too must walk a fine line between the demands of the party elite and the needs of the faithful.\nThe Washington-based Human Rights Watch/Asia has said Beijing has been stepping up harassment of unauthorised Catholic and Protestant groups in recent years.\nThe group said the crackdown on Christians included stricter controls on contacts with foreigners and was part of a broader drive begun in 1994 against all forms of religion as well as political dissent.\nBishop Zong Huaide of the state-backed church ordained five graduates of the seminary on Sunday. Zong delivered mass at the Church of the Holy Saviour, built in 1703, which was packed with about 3,000 people.\nChina has 31 seminaries and about 1,100 priests, 700 of whom are state-anointed young men.\nThe official Catholic Church in China counts four million members, while the underground church is believed to have several million members.\nVatican relations with Beijing have alternately cooled and warmed over the decades since the late 1950s, when links were severed over the Vatican\'s recognition of Taiwan.\nChina has said it will not normalise relations until the Vatican severs its ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nThe Vatican, on the other hand, has demanded recognition of the Pope\'s primacy before it renews ties with China.\n'

a(S'Chinese President Jiang Zemin tried to reassure Taiwanese businessmen on Thursday, saying Beijing would not allow political differences to stand in the way of trade and investment.\n"We maintain that political differences should not be allowed to affect and interfere with economic cooperation between the two sides," state radio quoted Jiang as telling visiting Taiwanese business leaders.\nThe economies of China and Taiwan were complementary, Jiang said, adding that the two sides should strengthen economic cooperation to benefit the entire Chinese race.\n"We will continue to carry out our long-time policy of encouraging Taiwanese businessmen to invest," Jiang was quoted as saying. "No matter what the circumstances, we will protect all legitimate rights of Taiwanese investors."\nA delegation of nearly 80 Taiwanese business leaders and politicians arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are part of the delegation in a private capacity.\nTaiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since 1949 when the nation\'s Nationalist rulers fled to the island after their defeat by the communists.\nIndirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.\nJiang said China has always sought to speed up the establishment of direct trade and transport links with Taiwan.\nBeijing has stepped up pressure on the island to lift the ban. Last week it unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nKao Ching-yuan, head of the delegation, urged Beijing on Wednesday to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island\'s investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.\nThe talks were suspended last year after Taiwan\'s President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing views the island as a rebel province and insists it is not entitled to official links with other states.\nKao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, a major Taiwanese conglomerate, was quoted by state television as saying the Chinese market had great potential and many Taiwanese businessmen were pushing for expanded economic cooperation.\nPresident Enterprises is Taiwan\'s biggest investor in China.\nKao\'s visit came less than two weeks after Taiwan\'s President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.\nThe Taiwanese delegation was the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Lee\'s mid-1995 U.S. visit.\n'

a(S'The seven-year-old boy chosen by China as Tibet\'s second holiest monk attended a ritual in Beijing last week to celebrate the first anniversary of his enthronement, major Chinese newspapers said on Wednesday.\nMonks pounded drums, rang bells and chanted Buddhist scriptures as Beijing\'s choice as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama visited the Yonghe Lamasery -- the Temple of Harmony and Peace, on November 22, the newspapers said, quoting a report by the official Xinhua news agency.\nXinhua gave no reason for the delay in reporting the celebrations which were held a week before the actual anniversary on November 29.\nTibet\'s exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, has named another boy as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Himalayan region\'s second holiest monk who died in 1989.\nMany Tibetans see the Chinese-sanctioned child, Gyantsen Norpo, as a pretender.\nState media has given Beijing\'s choice much publicity in an apparent bid to convince Tibetans that he is the real reincarnation.\nMajor Chinese newspapers on Wednesday ran a picture of the child wearing traditional robes and a cap and surrounded by monks as he toured the Yonghe Lamasery which was built in 1694.\nThe boy blessed believers and preached from the seat reserved for the 10th Panchen Lama before his death.\nChinese sources have said Beijing\'s choice currently lives in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans.\nWestern human rights groups have accused Beijing of detaining the boy recognised by the Dalai Lama and persecuting monks and nuns who refused to accept Beijing\'s choice.\nThe London-based human rights watchdog Tibet Information Network said last week a 19-year-old Tibetan nun had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing\'s choice.\nChina denies the accusations, saying the Dalai Lama\'s choice is "leading a free life, just like other Tibetan children".\nBut Beijing has refused to reveal the whereabouts of the Dalai Lama\'s choice or allow diplomats or foreign reporters to meet the boy.\nChina has lashed out at the exiled Tibetan leader, quoting the boy it anointed as the Panchen Lama as saying the Dalai Lama was the cause of turmoil in the region.\nThe Dalai Lama fled his homeland along with thousands of followers in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He heads a government-in-exile, which is not recognised by any country, in the Indian town of Dharamsala.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet\'s holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.\n'

a(S'China on Thursday savoured its latest victory in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Taiwan, while the stunned island scrambled to limit the damage from South Africa\'s decision to abandon it.\nSouth African President Nelson Mandela said in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.\nBeijing hailed the move, saying it was in South Africa\'s interest.\n"We ...welcome President Mandela\'s positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa," Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing in Beijing.\n"If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interest to do so," Cui said.\nBeijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nChina regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.\nSouth Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan\'s exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People\'s Republic on the mainland.\nThe Chinese government spokesman said the People\'s Republic was the sole, legitimate government of all China.\n"South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan," Cui said.\nWealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan was stunned by Mandela\'s announcement and scrambled to limit the damage by urging its 29 other allies not to be swayed by China.\n"We hope such a situation won\'t affect our diplomatic relations with other countries...," Taiwan\'s Foreign Minister John Chang said in a televised news conference in Taipei.\n"We will actively negotiate with South Africa in the next 12 months," Chang said, adding that he might visit South Africa before an official visit scheduled for January.\nSouth Africa\'s Ambassador to Taiwan Johannes Viljoen urged the island not to exact reprisals against Pretoria.\nBut Taiwan\'s top economic planner said the island would not continue to encourage investment in South Africa.\nTuntex, one of the island\'s major business groups, said earlier on Thursday it would respect the government\'s wishes in deciding whether to move ahead with a planned $3 billion petrochemical project in South Africa.\nTaiwan officials said they would conduct an overall review of Taiwanese investments in South Africa, currently totalling over $1.5 billion.\nSouth Africa\'s decision to switch ties to China sent Taiwan stocks into a brief dive, but the market had recovered by the close. Many businesssmen played down any potential for serious, long-term harm.\nThe Taiwan dollar closed little changed against its U.S. counterpart despite news of the island\'s diplomatic setback.\nTaiwanese officials blamed China for South Africa\'s decision to ditch Taiwan, saying China was "buying" foreign ties and damaging chances for reunification between the longtime rivals.\nThere were no protests at Pretoria\'s embassy in Taipei, contrasting with the public outrage displayed in previous years after Washington, Seoul and other former allies dropped Taipei for Beijing.\n'

a(S'China has retired its navy and air force commanders due to old age, a source familiar with the reshuffle said on Tuesday.\nAdmiral Zhang Lianzhong and Lieutenant General Yu Zhenwu, both 65, have stepped down as navy and air force commanders respectively, said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nZhang was replaced by navy deputy commander Rear Admiral Shi Yunsheng, 56, the source said. Yu was succeeded by air force deputy commander Liu Shunyao, believed to be in his early 50s.\nCommunist Party boss Jiang Zemin approved the reshuffle in October in his capacity as chairman of the party\'s Central Military Commission, or commander-in-chief of the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), the source said.\nAsked if the reshuffle was intended to further consolidate Jiang\'s power in the military, the source said Zhang and Yu retired due to old age.\n"It\'s professionalisation of the military," the source said.\nHowever, a Chinese analyst said the four vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission were already aged between 67 and 82 and still active. The two youngest vice-chairmen were appointed by Jiang.\nBoth the new appointees are believed to be proteges of Jiang, another analyst said. Jiang ordered the promotions of Shi and Yu to navy and air force deputy commanders in January, 1995 and December, 1994 respectively, the analyst said.\nSome diplomats and Chinese analysts have dismissed Jiang as a transitional figure lacking the personal clout, political power base and administrative ability to step into the shoes of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after the death of the 92-year-old patriarch.\nBut Jiang, who has no military pedigree, has moved in recent years to shore up his position in the military with a string of reshuffles.\nThe PLA is the world\'s largest armed force with three million members.\nIt is believed to be planning to pare that number by 500,000 in a streamlining that reflects the end of the Cold War and a desire to redirect state funds to economic development.\n'

a(S'A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of veteran dissident Liu Nianchun against a labour camp term for writing petitions, saying freedom of speech must not endanger the security of the state.\nBeijing\'s Chaoyang District Court rejected Liu\'s lawsuit on Monday on the grounds that a petition he initiated in 1995 "contained attacks against the people\'s government", said a copy of the verdict seen by Reuters on Tuesday.\nThe petition "exceeded the limits of the constitution and the law", the verdict said.\nLiu had argued in his appeal that the constitution guaranteed his right to freedom of speech.\nThe court rejected Liu\'s argument, saying freedom of speech "must not endanger the security, honour and interests of the state", the verdict said.\nLiu\'s wife, Chu Hailan, said she would appeal even though chances of victory were slim. She has 15 days in which to file an appeal.\n"I will definitely appeal. This is our right," Chu said by telephone on Tuesday. She attacked the court ruling as "unfair... not objective and unjust".\nChu said that during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China last month police had shunted her to a labour camp in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang where her husband is held to prevent her meeting U.S. officials.\n"It\'s a very desolate place. Life\'s awfully hard there," she said. "Liu Nianchun... eats only two meals a day."\nShe said her husband was sharing a 14-square-metre (150 square-ft) cell with 15 other people.\nLast July, police ordered Liu, 48, to serve three years of re-education through labour on top of nearly one year in detention for drafting the petition, which urged the government to re-evaluate its crackown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and to free all political prisoners.\nHe was also accused of accepting illegal aid from human rights organisations abroad and of trying to form a group to promote protection of workers\' rights.\nRe-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by the authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.\nWestern human rights activists say it is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial.\nLiu took part in the Democracy Wall movement of the early 1980s and was sentenced in 1981 to a three-year jail term for "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement", or subversion.\nProminent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan, who drafted the petition together with Liu, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government -- a sentence that triggered international condemnation.\nChina dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\nThe Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement in recent months.\nMost dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or in labour camps.\nThree pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui.\nIn the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that adjoins Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government.\n'

a(S'China pledged on Wednesday to curb a rush by provinces to invest in high-profile industries, but economists said defiance from regional authorities would impede attempts by the central government to restructure the economy.\nThe People\'s Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said many new state enterprises were doomed from the beginning due to blind investment in many provinces.\n"From the day production began, (many enterprises) entered a vicious cycle of high investment, high consumption of resources, low production efficiency and poor management," the newspaper said in a front-page commentary.\nMany old enterprises, unable to upgrade their technology, lose their competitive edge and become inefficient, it said.\nThe newspaper said blind investment was widespread, citing 22 provinces that listed car production as one of their pillar industries in their Five-Year Plan between 1996 and 2000 and the plan for 2010.\nTwenty-four provinces listed electronics as one of their pillar industries through 2000, and 16 provinces said they would concentrate on machinery and chemicals, the newspaper said.\n"This has been a major problem for China\'s economy for a long time," economist Mao Tianqi said in a telephone interview when asked about the blind investment.\nBlind investment had also led to monopolies and local protectionism, with many provinces banning competitive products from neighbouring regions, the newspaper said.\nIt said China\'s economic structure was "unreasonable", with too many small enterprises, not enough large enterprises, too many low-end products and insufficient high technology items.\nThe central government planned to restructure the economy next year to curb concentration in high-profile industries and to boost efficiency, the newspaper said.\n"Restructuring the economy...is a mission of extreme importance," it said.\nThe central government would try to divert investment into the manufacturing of products with big demand as well as high technology products, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate.\nThe government would try to break monopolies by encouraging joint ventures among provinces, the newspaper said, adding that business groups would be encouraged to shed affiliates that are not related to production, such as hospitals and kindergartens.\n"There are many difficulties and contradictions in adjusting and improving the economic structure, but...the State Council\'s (cabinet\'s) determination will not waver," the newspaper said.\nBut economist Mao was not optimistic.\n"This is not a problem that can be resolved in one year," Mao said.\nMany local governments would defy or skirt decisions by the central government to limit investment in certain industries to a few regions, he said.\nAbout one percent of China\'s estimated 100,000 state enterprises are hopelessly in debt and unattractive to investors looking for cheap companies to buy or to merge with.\nThe government has been dragging its feet on bankruptcies due to fears of mass unemployment and social unrest.\nHowever, the number of bankruptcies in China -- unheard of for almost four decades -- was expected to more than double to 5,200 this year, or more than the total of the previous six years put together.\n'

a(S'China\'s parliament, eager to shed its rubber stamp image, has vowed to crack down on lawless officials by intensifying supervision of the government\'s executive and judicial branches.\nTian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People\'s Congress, had conceded that the problem of officials disregarding the law was very serious in some departments, major newspapers said on Friday.\n"Some officials are not strict when implementing the law and do not investigate legal violations," Tian told the opening of a nine-day seminar in the booming southern city of Shenzhen on Thursday.\n"These phenomena are very serious in some regions and departments," said Tian, a member of the ruling Communist Party\'s 19-member Politburo.\nOfficial media frequently carry reports of abuse of power by local officials, who run their areas of jurisdiction as virtual fiefdoms. The word of an official is often taken as law.\n"Some officials go as far as to replace the law with their word," Tian said. "There are laws but some officials do not do things according to the law.\n"Some use power to suppress the law, those enforcing the law break the law and some take the law into their own hands."\nSome Chinese analysts saw Tian\'s remarks as an attempt to increase the say of parliament in Chinese politics.\nTian and his mentor, Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People\'s Congress, who sits on the party\'s omnipotent seven-member Standing Committee, have moved in recent years to boost the status of parliament.\nTian urged lawmaking bodies at all levels to step up supervision of the executive and judicial branches.\n"Supervision is a very weak link of the work of the People\'s Congress," Tian said.\nHe urged all lawmakers to conscientiously supervise trials and the work of the government, prosecutors and police.\nLast month, a court took 10 minutes to reject the appeal of dissident and former student leader Wang Dan and uphold an 11-year jail term for conspiring to subvert the government.\nAnother dissident, Chen Longde, attempted suicide in August by jumping from a third-floor window because he could no longer stand beating by guards at a labour camp, his family has said.\nThe labour camp denies any wrongdoing.\nChen, who broke his right leg and smashed three teeth, has been discharged from hospital and sent back to the labour camp, where he is serving three years of re-education through labour for sending a petition to parliament demanding the release of all political prisoners.\nRe-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.\nWestern human rights activists say the punishment is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial.\n'

Earlier, the office denied Taiwanese newspaper reports that Wang had accepted the invitation.\nKao is head of a delegation of nearly 80 Taiwanese businessmen, economists and officials, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a 12-day visit.\nChinese President Jiang Zemin met members of the delegation on Thursday and tried to reassure Taiwanese investors, saying Beijing would not allow political differences to stand in the way of trade and investment.\nIn his meetings with other Chinese officials, Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, had raised tax and labour problems faced by Taiwanese investors in China, the delegation\'s spokesman said.

a(S'The Commmonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) warned again on Tuesday of a subdued profit outlook for the current 1996/97 year and beyond, citing a competitive housing market, falling margins and higher wage costs.\nCBA chairman Tim Besley told shareholders at the bank\'s annual meeting that nothing in the first three months of the year had changed earlier forecasts of flat profits in the current year to June 30, 1997.  \n"We are now three months into the financial year and nothing has changed to prompt the bank to revise this assessment," Besley said in his chairman\'s address.\n"1996/97 is shaping up to be every bit as challenging as we envisaged," he said.\n"The home loan market remains intensely competitive."\nCommonwealth Bank reported a net profit of A$1.12 billion in 1995/96, up from A$983 million in 1994/95, and said when it released its results in August that it expected earnings to be flat in 1996/97.  \nBesley said CBA\'s directors aimed to maintain the ratio of dividends per share to earnings per share at around 80 percent in 1996/97.\nHowever, Besley also said later at the meeting that banking industry profits could fall over the long run and that CBA would have to work hard to ensure its profit falls were less than those of other banks.\n"We have to be sure that ours (profits) come down by as little as any of the others," Besley said in answer to a shareholder\'s question.  \nBesley later told reporters banking industry profits would be under pressure in the future.\n"The industry will be under pressure of falling profits unless, just like in any other industry, it pays great attention to its costs and gets very efficient," he said.\n"There\'s no suggestion that (the CBA\'s) profits would fall off this year," he said, adding that it was the bank\'s objective to increase profits in 1997/98.\nCBA Managing Director David Murray also played down Besley\'s earlier comments. "I read that comment to mean a fall in the growth rate in profits," he said.  \nWhen asked if he too aimed for a rebound from the flat 1996/97 to profit growth in 1997/98, Murray said: "Yes. It means marketing better and containing our costs."\nBut he said it was too early to be specific about a possible profit rise in 1997/98. Murray however also told the annual meeting that cost control would be difficult.\nHe said CBA had restricted wages growth to four percent in the two years before the most recently negotiated enterprise bargaining agreements.  \n"That (four percent over two years) is clearly not sustainable with the inflation rate and wage expectations where they are but we continue to bargain hard on that front."\nCBA\'s share price closed down 11 cents at A$11.90, having earlier fallen to A$11.80 on the bearish comments from the annual meeting. "It\'s all on this talk of no earnings growth and wages pressure," one Melbourne broker said before the late session bounce.\nMurray and Besley also repeated their view that official interest rates were more likely to be cut than raised before the end of the year.  \n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

"We\'ll win through there. How or where I don\'t know but we\'ll just keep the pressure on," he said.\nTurner said on Thursday that Murdoch\'s lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner, which creates the world\'s biggest media company, was a "frivolous piece of junk."\nMurdoch and Turner have fought a pitched battle in recent months over the merger. At issue is whether Time Warner, the United States\' second-largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch\'s new all-news channel that will compete with CNN.\nNews Corp. is seeking $1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News Corp.\'s 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition.\n"They promised me very firmly we\'d have 9 million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren\'t there," Murdoch said in the interview, referring to Time Warner\'s decision not to carry the new channel.\nTurner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic.\nMurdoch also confirmed his bullish outlook for News Corp.\'s profits.\n"If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly," a 20 percent rise in profits is attainable, he told the Courier Mail. "But it is still early days to be saying that."\nNews Corp. said after releasing its results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was attainable. News earned A$1.02 billion ($790 million) net profit in fiscal 1996.\nMurdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News Corp.\'s major competitor in newspaper market.\nHe said Australian-based rival media owner Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon.\n"I don\'t want to buy Fairfax. I don\'t believe Mr. (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax," he was quoted as saying.\n"To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He\'d like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he\'s too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today\'s price."\nCanada\'s Conrad Black, whose Hollinger International Inc. owns 25 percent of Fairfax and who has expressed a desire to take control of the group, expressed surprise at Murdoch\'s comments.\n"(Murdoch\'s statement) is fairly humorous. It\'s a bit rich given the fact that he never stops telling me how much he would like to own Fairfax," Black said by telephone Friday.\n"I cannot obviously comment on what the others are doing or what Rupert\'s motives are. The fact is that he regularly expresses to me considerable hypothetical interest in Fairfax," he said.\nHollinger International owns the Chicago Sun-Times, daily and weekly publications in the United States and the Jerusalem Post.\n'

a(S'Rupert Murdoch predicted in a newspaper interview on Friday that his global media group News Corp Ltd was on track to boost profits 20 percent this year and would win its legal battle with Ted Turner and Time Warner.\nMurdoch, visiting Australia for News\' annual meeting next Tuesday, also told News\' Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane that he did not want to buy out Australia\'s other major newspaper publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.\nNews, which publishes the major tabloid newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne as well as the Courier Mail and The Australian, also owns about five percent of Fairfax.\nRejoining his recent feud with CNN owner Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch said he was confident News would win its law suit launched last week against Turner and Time Warner over their proposed merger.\n"We\'ve got a good stoush (fight) there," Murdoch said.\n"We\'ll win through there. How or where I don\'t know but we\'ll just keep the pressure on," he said.\nTurner said on Thursday that Murdoch\'s lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc and Time Warner was a "frivolous piece of junk."\nMurdoch and Turner have fought a pitched business battle in recent months over Turner\'s plans to merge his Cable News Network (CNN) with Time Warner, creating the world\'s largest media group.\nAt issue is whether Time Warner, the United States\' second largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch\'s soon-to-be launched competitor to CNN.\nNews Corp is claiming US$1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News\' 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition.\n"They promised me very firmly we\'d have nine million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren\'t there," Murdoch said of the Time Warner decision.\nTurner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic.\nMurdoch also reaffirmed News\' bullish outlook for profits.\n"If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly (the 20 percent rise is attainable)," he told the Courier Mail.\n"But it is still early days to be saying that," the newspaper quoted Murdoch as saying.\nNews said after its 1995/96 results in late August that a 20-percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was very attainable. News posted a A$1.02 billion (US$790 million) net profit in 1995/96.\nBut it did not repeat the 20-percent forecast in its annual report last month, creating some doubt about the outlook.\nMurdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes the major broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News\' major competitor in newspapers.\nBut he said Australian-based rival mogul Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon if current goverment restrictions were lifted.\n"I don\'t want to buy Fairfax. I don\'t believe Mr (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax," he said.\n"To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He\'d like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he\'s too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today\'s price."\nMurdoch also criticised the conservative government of Australian prime minister John Howard for not implementing radical economic reforms immediately.\n(A$1 = US$0.79)\n'

a(S'News Corp Ltd chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch, visiting Australia for News\' annual meeting next week, says his global media group remains on track to boost profits by 20 percent in 1996/97.\nMurdoch, in a newspaper interview published on Friday, also ruled out any potential News Corp bid for Australian newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd and said Kerry Packer\'s Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd had repeatedly tried to sell its 15 percent Fairfax stake in the last year.\nNews Corp owns about five percent of Fairfax.  \nRejoining his recent feud with CNN owner Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch also said he was confident his law suit against the two would succeed.\nTurner said on Thursday that Murdoch\'s lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc and Time Warner was a "frivolous piece of junk."\nMurdoch said he was confident he would win the legal action launched last week to block the Turner merger with Time Warner.\n"We\'ve got a good stoush (fight) there," Murdoch said.\n"We\'ll win through there. How or where I don\'t know but we\'ll just keep the pressure on," he said.  \nMurdoch repeated News\' bullish outlook for profits.\n"If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly (the 20 percent rise is attainable)," he told News Corp\'s Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane.\n"But it is still early days to be saying that," the newspaper quoted Murdoch as saying.\nNews Corp said after its 1995/96 results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was very attainable. News posted a A$1.02 billion net profit in 1995/96.  \nMurdoch then said the government\'s investigation of the current cross-media rules, which stop the dual ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same city, would benefit Packer. Murdoch predicted the cross-media restrictions would be removed, but that foreign ownership rules would stay.\n"So it will leave things open for him (Packer) and not for us," Murdoch said.\nThe rules currently stop Packer\'s Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd from increasing its 15 percent holding in Fairfax while it owns the top-rating Nine Network.  \nThey also stop Murdoch\'s News from increasing its 15 percent stake in the Seven Network Ltd while it owns News Ltd newspaper publishing change. Foreign ownership rules stop News from increasing its five percent stake in Fairfax.\nAsked what he expected to emerge from the government\'s investigation into the cross-media rules, Murdoch said: "I think whatever Mr Packer wants. He seems to have very close influence with certain ministers in this government."\nMurdoch would not name the ministers.\nHowever Packer was unlikely to push for a higher Fairfax stake at the moment, Murdoch said.  \n"I don\'t want to buy Fairfax. I don\'t believe Mr (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax," he said.\n"To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He\'d like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he\'s too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today\'s price."\nFairfax is 25 percent owned by Conrad Black\'s Hollinger International Inc, which is majority owned by Hollinger Inc.  \nMurdoch also criticised the conservative government of Australian prime minister John Howard for not implementing decisive changes to boost the economy.\n"If you\'re going to make radical changes, you\'d better make them in the first year," Murdoch said of the government, which defeated the Labor government in the election on March 2.\n"I think they\'ve been slow to do that and not appearing as radical a government as I would have hoped," he said.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'News Corp Ltd\'s unveiling on Tuesday of plans to run its finances more conservatively were welcomed by analysts who have sometimes been critical of News\' previous big debt and equity issues.\nRupert Murdoch, the chief executive and chairman of the global media group, told the company\'s annual meeting in Adelaide that News now had over US$2.5 billion of cash in the bank after a bond issue last week and planned to keep it there.\n"We know that we have to be not only viable and profitable, but also that we should stay strong and liquid," Murdoch said.  \nMurdoch then said News Corp\'s multi-billion dollar plans to create huge pay television networks in the United States, Asia, Japan, Latin America and Australia would be financed from cash flow. He also said News Corp needed to keep its liquidity up to finance new acquisitions.\n"We have outlined these plans to show you where we are and where we plan to go. As far as possible, we will finance them out of current cash flow to maintain liquidity so that we will be ready to take new opportunities as they arise," he said.  \nAnalysts said the comments indicated a more conservative financial strategy, constrasting with the big acquisitions, investments and big debt and equity issues of the past.\nThe analysts said the market, which has sometimes been critical of the big deals and the big calls on the market, would welcome the comments.\nNews Corp\'s issue of preference shares earlier this year to fund the US$2.48 billion buy out of New World Communications upset many and triggered a slump in the price of the preference shares.  \n"It\'s slightly more conservative and the market will like it," said Macquarie Equities media analyst Alex Pollak of Murdoch\'s latest approach.\n"The market is absolutely paranoid that they\'ll go out and spend A$1.5 billion on something that they will not like," Pollak said.\n"Anything with more money spent on the big picture stuff, they\'re not going to like much," he said, adding the market wanted News to concentrate on ploughing money into its existing pay television networks in the United States.  \nAnalysts said Murdoch\'s comments about keeping the US$2.5 billion in the bank and financing projects from cashflows indicated any acquisitions would be small by Murdoch standards.\n"That imposes a huge financial discipline on the company which would hearten the market immensely," said a Sydney media analyst. "If he can keep to those comments then it\'s most certainly a big plus," he said.\nNews Corp shares closed 14 cents or 1.9 percent lower at A$7.20 after Murdoch said the first quarter was not up to earlier expectations of a 20 percent profit rise in 1996/97. But he said News remained on track for that 20 percent rise.  \n"If they can\'t meet their expectations in the first quarter when the strong revenues from \'Independence Day\' are coming, then what hope do they have for the full year," one analyst said.\nThe hit movie was made by News Corp\'s Twentieth Century Fox subsidiary.\n"His comments about the first quarter were weaker than what people were anticipating and it looks like U.S. television was one are of disappointment," another analyst said.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) took the unusual step on Monday of categorically denying a newspaper report which said it was investigating a A$24 billion merger with Britain\'s Standard Chartered Plc.\n"ANZ advises that it is not investigating or discussing a merger with Standard Chartered Bank," ANZ said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange just before the start of trade.\n"Whilst we do not normally comment on rumours and speculation regarding mergers and acquisitions the very specific nature of the article requires this definite denial," the ANZ said in a statement.\nEarlier, an ANZ spokesman had told Reuters that the report was in the category of market speculation and would not be commented on.\nIn its Monday edition, the Australian Financial Review reported that the two banks had engaged Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corp to conduct a feasibility study into a merger "along the lines of the RTZ-CRA stock stapling".  \nRTZ Corp Plc and CRA Ltd merged to become a dual-listed company and the world\'s biggest mining group in December last year.\n"Such an alliance would make ANZ almost takeover-proof in Australia, preserving the relative independence of one of the two major banks considered most likely takeover targets after the Wallis inquiry into the financial system," the Financial Review said.  \n"There are no cross-shareholdings between ANZ and Standard Chartered and the issue of \'senior partner\' in a stock stapling would be expected to be significant as would government and regulatory approval of the deal," the paper said, adding that KPMG had been employed to carry out due diligence on the deal.\nThe bank\'s surprisingly specific denial came after analysts said ANZ\'s share price could drop sharply on the report.\nThe analysts said the merger as outlined in the report was unlikely to include much if any takeover premium for shareholders, meaning the premium of up to 10 percent built into the current share price would be stripped out.  \n"People are saying \'What\'s in it for shareholders?\'," BNP Equities banking analyst Linda Lyon said.\n"If a merger like that looks like coming off, then the price will come off," Lyon said.\n"The sort of deal we\'re talking about doesn\'t include any sort of takeover premium for shareholders," said a senior Sydney banking analyst.\n"People have been buying ANZ above its true value in expectation NAB (National Australia Bank Ltd ) will launch a takeover post-Wallis," the analyst said.  \n"My guess is that the immediate reaction would be negative," he said, adding he saw ANZ\'s true price at around A$6.50.\nBut after the denial, ANZ\'s share price rose with the rest of the market. It was up two cents at A$7.18 at 12.50 p.m. (0150 GMT).\nAnalysts said such a merger could however also bring out a potential rival takeover bidder such as HSBC Holdings Plc.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Gold miner Niugini Mining Ltd, which owns 17.15 percent of the shares in Papua New Guinea\'s Lihir Gold Ltd, said on Monday it was looking at ways of giving those Lihir shares back to its shareholders.\n"We\'re looking at the possibility of returning the Lihir shareholding to shareholders and when that can be done," Nuigini Mining chief executive Ian Goudie told Reuters.\nGoudie said a straight forward return of the shares to shareholders could not approved until late 1998 given the Lihir mine\'s current debt arrangements.  \nBut Nuigini was also looking at other structures through which the shares could be returned before then, he said.\nHe said the Lihir share return was just one of several possible ways of unlocking the true value of the Lihir stake, which was not reflected in Niugini\'s current share price.\n"The whole purpose is to unlock this mismatch," he said.\nNiugini\'s assets could viewed in two parts -- the Lihir stake and other smaller mining assets, he said.\n"If the two parts were to be separated they would appear to have more value to shareholders."\n'

a(S'Australian-based insurer QBE Insurance Group Ltd said on Tuesday that profit growth was likely to surge into the high teens for the full 1996/97 year after only a slight increase in its first quarter profit.\n"I\'m confident that it will be in the teens, and with a bit of luck it will probably be in the high teens," QBE managing director John Cloney told reporters after the group\'s annual meeting when asked about profit growth for the full year.\nEarlier QBE reported a first quarter net profit of A$28.5 million, up just slightly from A$28.0 million a year earlier.  \nQBE\'s full year net profit rose 15.1 percent to A$123.3 million in 1995/96 ended June 30.\nAnalysts said the first quarter result may have been disappointing, partly due to costs linked to the installation of a new computer system, but the bullish comments were a welcome tonic.\n"We\'re still very happy to see around 15 percent profit growth per annum," said First Pacific insurance analyst Greg Galton.\nQBE\'s share price responded in kind, rising 15 cents to A$6.70 in early Tuesday afternoon trade after Cloney\'s comments.  \nCloney also said that QBE expected reduced expense ratios over 1996/97 because of improved productivity linked to the new computer systems.\nQBE should also achieve its target of double digit premium growth from existing lines and lower acquisition costs, he said.\nHe also said he saw a continuation of the trend of previous years of increased dividends, but that the franking rate was likely to be reduced to about 50 percent as previously foreshadowed.  \nCloney said QBE\'s A$70 million acquisition of the British reinsurance assets of Allstate Insurance Co announced in September would also boost profits in 1996/97.\n"That will give us in excess of 15 percent return (on equity invested) in this fiscal year," he said.\nReferring to this strong rate of return from this latest acquisition, Cloney said QBE continued to be on the look-out for similarly profitable acquisitions.\n"We are on the lookout all the time, and there are a couple of things that may come to pass," Cloney said, adding however that he could not be more specific.  \nBut he said Australia was less likely to be a happy hunting ground for QBE because other competitors and banks were prepared to bid high prices and push down rates of return.\n"They\'re the sort of hurdle rates we set," he said, referring to the 15 percent-plus return likely from Allstate.\n"Because we\'re already earning 17 percent (return on shareholders funds) we\'re not in the position to spend up large and say we\'ll get a pay back in three or four years, because it will dilute our overall earnings," he said.  \n"So far as Australia is concerned, to acquire at the sort of hurdle rates of return we\'re looking for is a little difficult because I think there are more people interested in what\'s available here than overseas."\nCloney also ruled out any bank acquisitions.\n"QBE ought to be allowed to buy a bank if it wishes to do so but it is my own personal view and, I believe the view of the board, that we will not be doing that," he said.\n-- Bernard Hickey -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Stock-feed producer Ridley Corp Ltd forecast on Wednesday that slow demand and margin pressures would produce a flat first half year profit, but that a grain price slump would help boost profits for the full 1996/97 year.\n"All things considered we expect overall company after tax earnings to be in line with those of last year for the first half," Ridley Chairman John Keniry told the group\'s annual meeting.  \nStrong pasture growth in some areas which had significantly cut demand for stockfeed, along with margin pressures from high wheat prices earlier the year had combined to push Australian stockfood earnings lower in the first quarter of the year to June 30, 1997.\nFirst quarter earnings from Ridley\'s AgriProducts division had been below both budget forecast and last year\'s results, Keniry said.\nKeniry said Ridley expected another good result from its Canadian stock food supplier, Feed-rite, to offset the falls from Australia\'s AgriProducts in the first half.  \n"For the first quarter Feed-Rite\'s earnings before interest and tax have exceeded by a comfortable margin both budget and last year," Keniry said.\nBut he said a sharp slump in grain prices, one of Ridley\'s key inputs, could boost margins again in Australia later in the year if prices stayed down.\n"When we look to the full year, we must recognise a very rapid decline in the past month or so in grain prices, and the somewhat unpredicatble impact on both us and our customers of these changes," Keniry said.  \n"Nevertheless on a full year basis, a cautious approach would be to say that we presently expect to come in slightly ahead of last year," he said.\nRidley said last month it expected continued profit growth and was optimistic of achieving another record performance in the 1996/97 year to June 30.\nIt reported an operating profit of A$36.27 million million in 1995/96, up 14.3 percent on the previous year and hard on the heels of three to four years of significant profit rises.  \nLater, Ridley managing director Gary Busenshut reiterated the flat immediate outlook but more buoyant longer term prospects for the year.\n"As we harvest between October and January, we\'re going to see some improvement in margins," he said.\nBusenshut said Ridley also continued to focus on further acquisitions both in Australia and in North America, particularly now that its A$98 million takeover bid for Australian malster Joe White Maltings Ltd looked unlikely to succeed.  \nThe A$5.44 per share offer was rejected by Joe White and Ridley has said it would not increase the offer before it closes on November 8. Ridley now has about 18 percent of Joe White.\nRidley would continue to look at potential malting acquisitions in Australia and stock-feed milling operations in North America, Busenshuts said.\nHe said Ridley had had discussions with potential feed-milling targets in North America and could carry out an acquisition worth about A$100 million by the end of the March quarter of 1997 if it decided to. Ridley\'s shares closed up one cent at A$1.70.  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Water filtration company Memtec Ltd is confident the failure of its planned US$280 million takeover bid for U.S. medical filtration company Gelman Sciences Inc will not affect earnings or its U.S. expansion plans.\nMemtec chairman Denis Hanley told Reuters in a telephone interview from the United States that a compensation clause in the original takeover deal negotiated with Gelman meant it would not affect Memtec\'s earnings in the year to June 30, 1997.  \n"There were clauses in the contract that compensated us for our effort," Hanley said.\n"It will have no impact on our normal earnings," he said.\nIn July, Gelman said it had agreed to be taken over by the NASDAQ-listed Memtec, which offered 1.05 Memtec American Depositary Receipts (ADRS) for each Gelman share.\nThe offer than valued each Gelman share at about US$35 a share, but Memtec\'s share price fell after the July announcement and the agreement included a clause allowing Gelman to renegotiate or terminate the deal if Memtec\'s share price fell below US$30.  \nOn Monday, Gelman agreed to a takeover bid by fellow filtration company Pall Corp, which valued Gelman\'s shares at US$33 per share and effectively trumped Memtec\'s bid.\nMemtec then said on Tuesday it would not increase its bid and that the original merger agreement had been terminated.\nHanley said he and Memtec\'s management had spent months preparing for the Gelman takeover and organising a roadshow promoting the bid, but that Memtec had been compensated for the costs involved.\nHe said Memtec\'s likely growth in the United States this year would not be affected by failure of the deal.  \n"This year the growth we\'ll probably see will still be better than 50 percent without this deal," he said.\nMemtec remained on the lookout for expansion opportunities in the United States, particularly in the medical filtration sector.\n"We see many ways of getting into the medical market there," he said, adding however that he could not be specific about how Memtec would increase its presence.\nGelman makes microfiltration products for laboratories, healthcare, environmental monitoring, high-technology process industries and other uses.  \nThe end of the Gelman deal has pleased shareholders however, with Memtec\'s shares jumping A$3.50 to A$41.50 by Wednesday\'s close from its A$35 level on Monday.\nMemtec had been around A$42.50 in mid-July.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Rupert Murdoch\'s News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc, Australian media analysts said on Monday.\nNews Corp, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world\'s second largest telecommunications group, the analysts said.\n"It means they\'ll be in bed with a bigger, more powerful global telephony group," one senior Sydney media analyst said.\nAnalysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp\'s partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months.\n"It seems that MCI and News haven\'t been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better," said the Sydney analyst.\nThe prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp\'s shares last month.\n"There was a view that MCI wasn\'t real happy with it (the partnership) and may sell out, but now nothing\'s going to happen for 12 months at least," said another Sydney analyst.\n"The implications for News are quite positive."\nA Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to sell down its stake over the next 12 months. "The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least," one analyst said.\nMCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake to 13.5 percent. They agreed, among other things, to jointly set up an American satellite television operation -- ASkyB.\nBut progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire. Australian analysts said they would remain cautious towards ASkyB, given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI. MCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.\nAnalysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.\nMCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI wanted to sell a US$700 million satellite license to News.\nHe also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts\' increasing unhappiness with the deal.\nAnalysts also warned there was a potential regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc, and BT.\n"There\'s an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it," said a BT analyst.\nOther analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns.

a(S'Appliance and building products manufacturer Email Ltd reported a lower half year net profit and dividend on Monday but forecast that recent restructuring and a seasonal lift would boost profits in the second half.\nEmail said the environment for industrial activities remained difficult and recent economic forecasts had deferred the timing of an upturn in building sector.  \n"Nevertheless, the significant improvements in the company\'s pre-tax operating profits flowing from restructuring across the past 12 months, are expected to continue in the second half," the company said in a statement accompanying half year results.\n"As well there should be the normal seasonal lift in sales and margins, leading to a second half profit well ahead of the first half," it said.\nEarlier Email reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$27.26 million for the first half to September 30, up from A$24.83 million the previous corresponding half a year earlier.  \nNet profit however fell to A$23.85 million from A$26.61 million the previous year, due largely to abnormal losses of A$3.41 million incurred in restructuring and reducing overheads. Email also cut its interim dividend to eight cents from 11.5 a year earlier, saying it had realigned dividends to reflect the stronger second half year in the light of continuing uncertainty about the economy.\nEmail Managing Director John Hanna later told Reuters Email expected pre-tax profits for the second half of the 1996/97 year would also be above those in the second half of 1995/96.  \n"We are expecting in the second half that we would have pre-tax operating profits higher than last year," Hanna said.\n"We should also have the second half seasonal lift."\nHe said Email was pleased that it achieved profit growth in its building products and major appliances divisions despite lower sales.\nAnalysts said the result was within expectations and was largely unsurprising, even with the dividend cut.\n"It\'s still a high payout ratio," said one Sydney analyst said of the dividend, noting that the final dividend was likely to be maintained.  \nEmail\'s share price was unchanged at A$3.55 at 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT) on light volumes.\nHanna said there could begin to be an upturn in the housing industry at the beginning of 1997, but that this would take some time to flow through to Email\'s business because its products were installed late in the building process.\n"If it (the upturn) was early 1997, then it (the resulting flow-on) would be in mid-1997," he said.\nBut this flow-on effect would then have an immediate effect on Email\'s bottom line because of the recent restructuring which had reduced overheads.  \n"As there\'s an upturn, we should get that immediately and a lot of that will go to the bottom line immediately," Hanna said.\nHe also said Email may increase its 20 percent stake in British electricity meter maker Ampy Automation Digilog Ltd.\n"There may be an opportunity to lift that stake in the future," Hanna said. He said Email remained on the lookout for further acquisitions.\n"They (any further acquisitions) would have to be in existing core areas ... but I don\'t think we have anything directly in line at the moment," he said.\n-- Bernard Hickey 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'National Mutual Holdings Ltd managing director Geoff Tomlinson said on Thursday that strong investment markets meant group earnings for the 1996/97 year were likely to be in line with the July prospectus forecasts.\n"It\'s been a very kind year. I can\'t think of when the markets have been more conducive to our type of business," Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview.  \nHe said he could not give a formal forecast of the profit result for the just completed year to September 30 but an examination of the assumptions in National Mutual\'s share offer document would show the forecasts were likely to be met.\n"You can go back and look at the investment assumptions in the share offer document and compare them with where we were at the end of September and we were in the fortunate position where most of the markets finished in line with predictions," he said.\n"That would give you some underlying view that it\'s likely that our performance will be in line with that projection."  \nNational Mutual forecast in its offer document a consolidated net profit after tax of A$198 million for the year ending September 30, up from A$115.5 million in 1994/95.\nThe assumptions underlying the forecast included an Australian 90 day bill rate of 7.5 percent as at September 30, a 10-year bond rate of 8.75 percent at September 30 and a U.S. 10 year bond rate of 6.50 percent as at September 30.\nThe offer document, issued before National Mutual demutualised and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange last month, said its profit was not significantly sensitive to its stock market assumptions.\n'

a(S'Australian-based metals recycler Simsmetal Ltd on Friday painted a bleak picture for world scrap metal prices over the year ahead and said this meant the group\'s net profit for 1996/97 would be lower than in 1995/96.\nBut it said it remained confident it could take advantage of a recovery in world markets when it came and was currently in talks to buy a large British scrap metal business.\nSimsmetal managing director John Crabb told the annual meeting that scrap prices had softened dramatically to their lowest levels in almost four years over the last two months.  \n"Until there is an improvement in the major economies of Europe and Asia and the resulting increase in demand for metals, we expect trading conditions to remain very difficult with volumes, margins and earnings below our expectations," Crabb said.\nHe later told reporters profits for the year to June 30, 1997 would be below the A$46.7 million posted in 1995/96 -- a result that was itself 23 percent down on a year ago.\n"It will be lower for the full year," Crabb said.  \nSimsmetal had previously only said it saw difficult conditions prevalent in the first quarter of 1996/97 continuing into the second quarter, with second quarter profits falling.\nIn mid-October, Simsmetal announced its net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97 fell 34 percent to A$8.28 million.\nCrabb said the world construction markets which used the long steel produced by electric furnaces supplied by Simsmetal remained weak and had no immediate prospect of improvement.\n"Our view is that we should start to see some improvement (in ferrous metals prices) towards the end of calendar 1997, we may see it in the middle (of calendar 1997)," he said.  \n"We can\'t see too much on the horizon at this time," he said.\nCrabb also said Simsmetal was in talks to buy a large British business in the same area as Simsmetal, but he said he could not give any more details as he was bound by confidentiality agreements.\n"It\'s in the U.K. For us it will be quite large," he said.\n"We still need to balance our portfolio there, so that we\'ve got a good broad coverage," he said.\n"We\'ll use either some cash or our unusued borrowing lines. We\'ve got no problems funding it."  \nHe said Simsmetal had ended the first quarter with about A$62 million cash on hand.\n"I guess we\'d only be using 55-60 percent of our borrowing capacity at the moment."\nSimsmetal had total non-current borrowings of A$54.11 million as at June 30, 1996, giving a total warchest for possible acquisitions of about A$115 million.\nEarlier in the annual meeting, Crabb said that any closure of the Broken Hill Pty Co Pty Ltd\'s Newcastle steel plant would not affect Simsmetals operations.  \nCrabb said Simsmetal supplies most of its products to BHP\'s Sydney mini-mill and its Port Kembla plant, south of Sydney.\n"Maybe it will make life easier for us because we will be able to buy more scrap," Crabb said, responding to a shareholders question.\nSimsmetal\'s shares were up one cent at A$6.89 at 2.40 p.m. (0340 GMT).\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy.\nAnalysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac\'s profits in 1996/97.\n"You\'re really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997," Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.  \n"There\'ll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997," he said.\n"You\'ll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing."\nThe median forecast in BZW\'s BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95.\nThis compares with a 44 percent rise between 1993/94 and 1994/95.\n'

a(S'World yeast and spices giant Burns Philp &amp; Co Ltd announced a hefty loss for the 1995/96 year on Wednesday after taking some heavy hits in a vicious U.S. price war and Asian expansion.\nBurns Philp, the western world\'s largest fresh bakers\' yeast maker and second largest spice maker, posted a net loss of A$61.8 million (US$48.8 million) for the year to June 30.\nThis came after abnormal losses of A$136.6 million, due largely to rationalisation of its U.S. operations and other costs linked to a spice price war with the world\'s largest spice maker, McCormick &amp; Co Inc of the United States.\nBurns Philp managing director Ian Clack said the tussle for market share in the United States appeared to have abated, but the cost of paying supermarkets for premium shelf space during the two-year war had to be written off.\nThe writing off of these costs, known as slotting contracts, made up A$33.9 million of the abnormal losses.\n"Recent slotting contracts have been negotiated with improved margins, indicating that market conditions are returning to a more acceptable level," Clack said.\nHe said Burns Philp had increased its U.S. spices market share by one percentage point to 16 percent after the war while McCormick\'s share had risen 1.5 points to 34 percent. Other U.S. spice makers lost market share, he said.\nBurns Philp has 16 percent of the western world\'s yeast market and seven percent of its spice market.\nCosts incurred during an Asian expansion also boosted Burns Philp\'s losses.\n"The result was also affected by the cost of expanding our presence in Asia together with plant upgrade costs in China and India," Clack said.\nThe result surprised brokers and analysts, who had expected large abnormal losses but were disappointed by a lower pre-abnormals net profit as well.\nNet profit before abnormal items fell to A$74.8 million, down from the A$104.1 million posted in 1994/95 and down on most analysts\' forecasts of about A$80 million.\nBurns Philp\'s decision not to post a final dividend also upset investors.\n"A woeful result and passing their dividend hasn\'t helped," said Jim Tredenick, senior dealer at broking house Nevitts Ltd.\nBurns Philp\'s share price closed down 10 cents at A$1.95.\nAnalysts also said there may be more abnormal losses to come, particularly in the value of intangibles like goodwill.\n"It was a bad result...the issue is whether or not they\'ve completely taken the knife to intangible valuations, that\'s the area where there could be some further writedowns," one Sydney analyst said.\n"They didn\'t take much off the intangibles. That (the A$30.7 million of intangible writedowns) hardly made a dent in it," another Sydney analyst said.\nClack said the company had taken the most conservative measure of intangible values it could and did not expect any more abnormal losses in the current year.\nHe said an earnings turnaround was possible in 1996/97. "In most markets we are seeing some improvement in the first two months of the year. There\'s been an improvement in demand, particularly in the North American markets." (A$1 = 79 U.S. cents)\n'

a(S'Australia\'s second-largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, announced a 19.5 percent rise in net profit for the 1995/96 year on Tuesday, but warned that fierce competition would flatten profits in the year ahead.\n"Everywhere you look and in every market we\'re in there\'s a lot of margin pressure," Westpac managing director Bob Joss told a news conference after the profit announcement.\n"It will be tough to make a rise," he said when asked if profits for the year to September 30, 1997, would be flat.\nWestpac reported net profit of A$1.132 billion (US$890 million) for the year to September 30, 1996, up 19.5 percent on 1994/95.\nBut this disguised a flat profit in the second half of the year and was boosted by a sharp drop in bad debt charges.\nJoss said competition from non-bank mortgage originators in the housing loan sector was a key factor pressuring margins.\nMortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and RAMS Home Loans, who have snared 10 percent of the mortgage market from big banks like Westpac over the last two years by offering cut price home loans.\nTheir entry into the market has dragged the big banks\' home loan margins down from over 300 basis points last year to just over 200 points now.\nJoss said Westpac would look to boost its own mortgage origination programme to help compete against the non-banks and support its margins.\nWestpac has already launched one issue of securitised mortgages worth A$340 million, the first of the major banks to do so.\nJoss said Westpac planned to multiply the size of such issues in the current year.\n"The real key for us will be to try to manage our balance sheet, have more assets off balance sheets, more securitising of lower margin assets," he said.\n"We just did one near the tail end of the (1995/96) year, A$340 million, so we would expect to see quite a bit more in the year ahead," Joss said.\nEven then, Westpac would struggle to maintain its margins and would have to cut costs and increase efficiency to compensate.\nThe bearish earnings comments and the detail of the result saw Westpac\'s share price close down 15 cents at A$7.05, despite the result being almost exactly the average of analysts\' forecasts.\nWestpac is the second major bank to forecast flat profits in the year ahead because of increased competition. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia since May has been forecasting flat profits over the next year.\nThese more sober forecasts signify the end of two to three years of sharp profit rises for the major banks as they recovered from hefty loan losses in the early 1990s and capitalised on a strong economy.\nA smaller New South Wales-based bank, St George Bank Ltd, echoed this new more subdued outlook for profits in its annual results also announced on Tuesday.\nSt George reported net profit of A$148.3 million for the 1995/96 year, a rise of 9.4 percent.\nSt George managing director Jim Sweeney said margin pressure meant it would be a challenge to improve profits in the first half of the current year.

a(S'Australia\'s second largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, announced a 19.5 percent rise in net profit for the 1995/96 year on Tuesday, but warned that fierce competition would flatten profits in the year ahead.\n"Everywhere you look and in every market we\'re in there\'s a lot of margin pressure," Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss told a news conference after the profit announcement.\n"It will be tough to make a rise," he said when asked if profits for the year to September 30, 1997 would be flat.  \nWestpac reported a net profit of A$1.132 billion for the year to September 30, 1996, up 19.5 percent on 1994/95, but this disguised a flat profit in the second half and was boosted by a sharp drop in bad debt charges for year.\nBad debt charges fell to A$121 million in 1995/96, down sharply from A$330 million in 1994/95, a fall which Westpac said contributed about A$200 million to the 12 percent rise in pre-tax and abnormals profit to A$1.389 billion.\nJoss said competition from non-bank mortgage originators in the housing loan sector was a key factor pressuring margins.  \nMortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and RAMS have taken over 10 percent of the mortgage market from the big banks including Westpac over the last two years, dragging home loan margins down from over 300 basis points to just over 200 points. Joss said Westpac would look to boost its own mortgage origination programme to help compete against the non-banks and support its margins.\nWestpac has already launched one issue of securitised mortgages worth A$340 million, the first of the major banks to do so.  \nJoss said Westpac planned to multiply the size of such issues in the current year.\n"The real key for us will be to try to manage our balance sheet, have more assets off balance sheets, more securitising of lower margin assets," he said.\n"We just did one near the tail end of the (1995/96) year, A$340 million, so we would expect to see quite a bit more in the year ahead," Joss said.\nWhen asked how much more than A$340 million, he said: "Multiples of A$340 million."\nEven then, Westpac would struggle to maintain its margin.  \nWestpac reported in its accounts for the year that the group\'s net margin had fallen to 370 basis points over the whole 1995/96 year, down from 380 basis points over 1994/95.\nJoss said the fall was already apparent towards the end of the year to September.\n"At the tail end of the year, it\'s actually less than what you would have seen for the year," Joss said.\nHe acknowledged Westpac would find it difficult to keep that margin from falling from 370 points.\nGiven the margin pressure, Westpac would continue to focus on increasing transaction and other fees to compensate.  \n"In such an environment, maintenance of overall net earnings growth will depend increasingly on attaining improvements in fee income generation, particularly non lending-related fees and on improved efficiency of operations," Joss said in an earlier statement.\nHe told the news conference he would like to see Westpac\'s efficiency ratio, which measures expenses to income, fall below 60 percent from the 62.6 percent evident in 1995/96.  \nThis ratio worsened during the year from 60.6 percent in 1994/95, due largely to the costs of acquiring and restructuring the Western Australian-based Challenge Bank and Trust Bank of New Zealand.\nJoss said rationalisations throughout Westpac over the next two years would help to lower costs, improve efficiency and therefore compensate somewhat for the slimmer margins.\nThe bearish comments from Joss helped Westpac close 15 cents lower at A$7.05.\n-- Bernard Hickey -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Airline giant British Airways Plc (BA) is unlikely to hike its airfares by the full three percent agreed to last week by the world\'s airlines, BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall said on Monday.\nThe world\'s airlines, desperate to hold up their profits in the face of a 40-percent surge in fuel prices this year, said in Geneva last week through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that they proposed to raise passenger fares by three percent.\nMarshall told reporters after a luncheon address in Sydney that BA was not as badly affected as some other airlines because of the strength of sterling against the U.S. dollar.\n"You also have to bear in mind that the impact for individual carriers does depend on exchange rates in that all aviation fuel is priced in U.S. dollar terms," he said.\n"So one has to watch what is happening to your own currency versus the U.S. dollar to see what the overall impact will be for a company," he said.\nWhen asked if the recent strength in sterling meant BA would therefore not pass on the full three percent agreed to in Geneva, he said: "I think that\'s quite likely."\nHe said BA had increased its prices by only about one percent before the Geneva resolution because of the strong currency.\n"The pound has been relatively strong against the dollar and that\'s why we only applied about a one-percent increase in price."\nIATA, which has 251 member airlines, said in Geneva the proposed increase, which is subject to government approvals, would apply to fares from December 15.\nMarshall said the extent to which the three percent increase was applied depended on each individual carrier and how fuel prices changed through the northern hemisphere\'s winter.\nMany European carriers are pushing for a concerted move to lift ticket prices by up to three per cent, but Asian and North American carriers were believed to be reluctant to do so.\nBA reported earlier this month that despite strong traffic growth and greater productivity its first half operating profits were down 2.1 per cent compared with last year.\nPart of the drop, it said, was due to the extra US$84 million it had had to pay for fuel.\nMeanwhile, Marshall said he was confident the European Union would not thwart BA\'s plan to form an alliance with American Airlines, although he acknowleged it would take the two a long time to jump the various regulatory hurdles in front of them.\n"I\'m not worried about it because I don\'t think that that is likely to happen," Marshall said of a possible EU block.\nOn Friday the European Commission (EC) said it had formally asked BA for details of the planned alliance.\nA report that the EC had said the alliance did not appear to be in the best interests of consumers pushed BA\'s shares lower earlier on Friday.\n"There are so many precedents for similar events that have been allowed to go into effect, that to me it would be quite wrong if the European Union reached that conclusion," he said.\n"I think things are all moving in the right direction, but it\'s just very slow," Marshall said of the regulatory process.\n'

a(S'The Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) on Tuesday bought a 13.4 percent stake in Macquarie Bank Ltd, removing the links between one of Australia\'s top four investment banks and its British founder.\nMacquarie said in a stock exchange statement just after the start of morning trading that the Brunei government-owned agency paid Lloyds TSB Plc A$151.7 million (US$122.8 million) for the stake.\nThe purchase by the agency\'s Brunei Investment and Commercial Bank (BICB) from Lloyds\' Hill Samuel &amp; Co unit makes it the largest individual shareholder in Macquarie.\nMacquarie Bank managing director Allan Moss said the bank had developed a good relationship with BIA and its senior management over the months it had taken to arrange the deal.\n"We are delighted that they have become associated with the bank as a major shareholder, and we are confident that BICB will prove to be a constructive and long term investor in Macquarie," Moss said.\nThe purchase ends Hill Samuel\'s 27-year direct involvement in the Australian investment banking sector.\nHill Samuel set up what is now known as Macquarie Bank in 1969 before selling down its stake to 30 percent in 1985 and then down to 15 percent in 1993.\nSince then Macquarie, which now has 1,800 staff, has listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and is now one of Australia\'s top 100 companies.\nIt has offices throughout Australasia and in China, Singapore, Malaysia, London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Indonesia and South Africa. Its asset base stood at A$5.17 billion on March 31, the end of its financial year.\nMacquarie also has more than A$20 billion in assets under management and has operations in corporate finance, sharebroking and in commodities, debt and foreign exchange trading.\nIt posted net profits of A$93.2 million in 1995/96.\nMacquarie Equities ranks amoung the top four brokers in terms of turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange and had the biggest inflow of retail funds for management in the year to June 30, 1996.\nMacquarie chairman David Clarke told a news conference he was confident that BICB was a stable shareholder.\n"By and large you only read announcements of them buying things and investing in things you don\'t read about them selling out of things," Clarke said.\nThe sale of the Hill Samuel stake appears to remove from the market a convenient bridgehead for a takeover bid from another Australian bank.\nAustralia\'s conservative government is currently reconsidering financial regulations governing bank takeovers.\nA report by the government-sponsored Wallis inquiry due in March next year is widely expected to trigger a series of bank takeovers.\n($A = US0.81 cents)\n'

a(S'An inquiry into Australia\'s financial system has left open the option of mergers among Australia\'s big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released on Wednesday.\nThe inquiry, established by the government and headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, outlined various options for reform and was careful not to state its own preferences.\nBut it said the key aim of any reforms should be increasing the efficiency of Australia\'s banks to compete globally and that new technology would transform the sector. Big banks such as the National Australia Bank Ltd have used the same reasoning lobbying for relaxed merger rules.\nThe banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition.\nPolicy set by the former Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia\'s four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.\nThe current conservative coalition government has said this so-called "six pillars" policy will remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry\'s recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997.\n"The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance," the paper said. Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said. It asked if competition and innovation could be stimulated by widening access to traditional banking activities through:\n* "Allowing direct non-bank access to the payments settlement system"\n* Better accomodating financial conglomerates\n* Allowing an increased range of institutions to provide a wider array of financial services, or\n* relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions ?"\nThe inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context "whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?"\nIn discussing the details of how bank mergers might be approved, the inquiry said there was widespread consensus that banks should be subject to the same competition rules as other industries. Currently any bank merger must be approved by the government through the Treasurer and by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This dual approval process does not apply in other industries.  \n"In undertaking its assessment, the Inquiry notes its preference...for all sectors of the economy to be subject to a uniform set of competitionpolicy laws unless there is something sepcial which justifies different treatment," the paper said.\nThe Inquiry said it would consider the following options for merger approvals, including;\n* keeping the current system of dual approval\n* having the Treasurer accept the ACCC\'s decision, or * narrowing powers over mergers in banking and insurance law It said there would be no need for a \'six pillars\' policy if the Treasurers powers were removed or if he agreed not to excercise them. "There was almost unanimous support that the \'six pillars\' policy should be abolished," the paper said.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Australia\'s wealthy baby-boomers are disillusioned with service provided by banks and believe loyalty is not rewarded, a survey released on Monday found.\nThose approaching retirement were also unhappy with the performance of their superannuation funds and were looking to move elsewhere wherever possible, the survey by forecaster BIS Shrapnel has found.  \n"Australia\'s affuent boomers -- the demographic group owning the largest share of private wealth -- are distrustful of the performance and motivations of financial institutions, and yearn for a return to the days when customer loyalty was rewarded," BIS Shrapnel said in the survey titled "Financial Services for the Affluent Boomers."\nThose surveyed had assets worth over A$150,000, excluding the family home.\nThe survey of 128 people aged over 45 in 14 seperate focus groups around Australia found they sought more individual treatment by knowledgable staff.  \n"In particular those approaching retirement are more likely to equate good service with personal service and contact," BIS Shrapnel survey project leader Geoff Ludowyke said.\n"They want to develop a relationship with one particular person within their banking branch," he said.\nThe survey found that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was the least liked of all the banks, Ludowyke said.\nRespondents found the CBA slower, more unfriendly, more impersonal and less modern than the other banks, he said.  \nWestpac Banking Corp Ltd was seen as the next least-liked bank while the ANZ Banking Group Ltd and the National Bank Ltd were seen in another group in-between CBA and the credit unions, which were the most favourably received.\nFormer building societies like St George Bank Ltd and Advance Bank Ltd, which are in the process of merging, were seen as similar to the credit unions.\n"Among the major banks with the most negative comments were the Commonwealth and Westpac," Ludowyke told Reuters.  \n"ANZ and NAB were in the next group while the credit unions were in another group out front," he said.\nThe survey also found that rich baby-boomers did not believe that swapping pension funds would improve their returns.\n"They intend to move away from superannuation," Ludowyke said.\nLaw changes were also generating anxiety about superannuation, he said. "Affluent boomers expect governments to continue to change the rules in a way that will benefit governments rather than contributors," he said.\nThe survey also found that banks were perceived as greedy.  \n"Reports of huge profits compound the resentment to bank fees and banks are believed to be primarily concerned with looking after their shareholders rather than their customers," the report said. "Affluent boomers are particularly annoyed by new charges for ATM and EFTPOS usage."\nLudowyke said BIS Schrapnel would approach the big financial institutions for funding for a more comprehensive survey of 800 people face to face on attitudes towards the financial institutions.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'The Reserve Bank of Australia\'s (RBA) rate cut on Wednesday is expected to further squeeze bank margins as competition has forced them to pass this cut on to their mortgage customers sooner than usual.\nThe major banks have previously delayed passing on the effect of official rate cuts to their variable rate home loan customers by around seven weeks.\nThey would, however, often begin lowering variable and fixed deposit rates immediately, providing a temporary widening of their margins.  \nWednesday\'s rate cut has seen the major banks shorten this delay in passing on the rate cut to about five and half weeks.\nAnalysts and some of the banks said increasing competition from non-bank mortgage lenders and the regional banks had been the major factor in this contraction.\nThey also said they expected this gap to narrow further when further official rate cuts are made next year.\n"The implication is a bit more pressure on margins," said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett banking analyst Michael Pulman.\n"This all about competition," he said.  \n"These competitive forces will end up contracting it down further, possibly down to 30 days," said Aussie Home Loans managing director John Symond.\nAussie, the biggest of the non-bank lenders funded by mortgage origination, said on Wednesday it would cut its variable rate to 7.49 percent from 7.99 percent from January 28 for existing customers, a gap of 48 days after December 11.\nAt the time of the last official rate cut on November 6, Aussie planned a gap of 46 days, which was lower than most of the banks.  \nIn response to Aussie and competition from regional banks like St George Bank Ltd, the large banks have cut back this delay.\nNational Australia Bank Ltd said it would cut its variable mortgage rate to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent from January 23 for existing borrowers, a gap of 43 days.\nAfter the last official rate cut NAB\'s gap was 54 days.\nIn line with this trend, Westpac Banking Corp\'s gap has dropped to 37 days from 41 days and Commonwealth Bank of Australia\'s gap has dropped to 48 days from 54.  \nThe Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has yet to announce any cut in variable mortage rates in response to the RBA\'s cut in the official cash rate to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.\nThe biggest move in the gap came from St George, which reduced the time it would pass on the rate cut for its major variable rate product to 20 days from 55 days.\nSt George has even said existing customers of its no frills variable rate product would receive the cut from December 18, a week away. This product provides 20 percent of its portfolio.  \nOverall the average gap for the banks who have cut their mortgage rates has dropped to 40 days after this rate cut from 49 after the November 6 cut, which was also by 50 basis points.\nThere may, however,be a limit to how much further this gap can fall, analysts and the banks said.\nA new regulatory code on credit specifies customers must be given 30 days notice whenever their interest rates are changed, creating an artificial barrier both up and down.\n"I think 30 days will about see it out," said Aussie\'s Symond.  \nAnalysts said the banks may try other tactics to cushion the effect of this reduction in the gap, but that it would still further reduce already-bruised margins.\n"It will have an effect on margins," said BNP Equities\' banking analyst Linda Lyon.\n"They\'ll do all sorts of other things to cushion the effect. They\'ll be trying to reduce their deposit rates as far and as fast as they can," said ABN AMRO\'s Mike Pulman.\n"But there\'s obviously a bit of a squeeze there, particularly for those banks most exposed to the housing sector," Pulman said.  \nCBA is seen as the most exposed with about 34 percent of its assets in home loans, with Westpac next on 25 percent and NAB and ANZ on about 17 percent.\nThe big bank\'s margins on home loans have already declined this year from about three percent in June to about 2.25 percent now.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812\n'

a(S'Australia-based transport, logistics and security group Brambles Industries Ltd said it was actively considering acquisitions in United States, Europe and Asia in the current year.\nBrambles chief executive John Fletcher told Reuters in an interview that Brambles would only look at acquisitions in areas where it had Australian experience.\n"You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here," he said.  \n"Anything new we\'ll do on home turf," he said.\nFletcher repeated that Brambles was looking at participating in the privatisation of Australia\'s airports being carried out before June next year.\nFletcher said the vehicle for airport investment would be Bramble\'s joint venture company, Australian Airport Services, formed with property and financial services company, Lend Lease Corp Ltd.\nBrambles would look at acquisitions in the Northern Hemisphere in the industrial services, waste management, equipment rentals and records management areas.  \nEarlier Brambles reported a 120.2 percent jump in net profit to A$215.1 million for the year to June 30, 1996. Before abnormals, the net profit rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the upper end of analysts\' expectations of A$208 million to A$214 million.\nFletcher said the result would have been a bit ahead of brokers\' expectations.\n"It\'s a marginally pleasant result rather than a huge shock," he said.\nStrong growth in earnings from Brambles CHEP pallet business in the United States helped boost the results.  \nFletcher said the Australian economy, which provides the bulk of Bramble\'s earnings, remained flat and was expected to remain so for some time.\n"We haven\'t got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy ... for at least another six months," he said.\nThe U.S. economy remained strong while Europe and Britain were flat, he said.\n"But all in all we\'ve got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year," he said.  \nProfits from Brambles overseas operations grew at twice the rate of those from local economies and this trend was likely to continue.\nThis continued overseas growth would however affect the allocation of franking credits on dividends.\n"The continuing growth expected in overseas earnings meant that the company would need to reduce moderately the level of franking of dividends declared on 1996/97 earnings," Fletcher said in an earlier statement.\nRecipients of franked dividends receive tax credits for Australian company tax already paid by the companies involved.  \nBrambles posted a 35 cents per share fully franked final dividend for 1995/96, up from a 33 cents per share final dividend in 1994/95.\nThe total dividend rose to 69 cents per share from 65 cents.\nEarnings per share rose to 97.6 cents from 84.8 cents.\nBrambles\' shares were down five cents at A$18.80 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT).\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'Almost 300 students and workers from the islands of Kiribati were adrift in the central Pacific on Wednesday aboard a crowded charter ship crippled by a fire, officials said.\nThe 1,000-tonne MV Maasmond appealed for help on Tuesday night after losing power through the fire in the engine room.\nIt was found by a Royal New Zealand Airforce Orion rescue plane drifting about 800 kms (500 miles) east of the Kiribati island of Tarawa with 290 passengers on board.\n"The Orion located it this afternoon and was told via radio that it\'s in no immediate distress and has enough food and water for five days," Airforce Squadron Leader Ron Irons told Reuters from the RNZAF\'s base in Nandi, Fiji.\n"It has partially restored its electric power, but it has no wasy to start its engine," Irons said.\nAn electrical fire in a switchboard in the engine room shut down the ship\'s electrical systems late on Tuesday, leaving the converted freighter without power and still two days sailing from the nearest land.\nThe ship\'s charterer, Kiribati businessman Waysang Kumkee, said the MV Maasmond\'s insurers would pay for another ship to tow it back to Tarawa.\nThe 64.5-metre (210 foot) Maasmond was chartered to carry 290 passengers, mostly Kiribati students and workers, and 400 tonnes of cargo to Christmas Island from Tarawa, Kumkee said.\nA tugboat was likely to take two days to reach the stricken ship and another two days to tow it back to Tarawa, he said, adding the passengers had plenty of food and water to last the four days.\n"It\'s not a problem. If they run out they can easily borrow some of the cargo," Kumkee told Reuters by telephone from Tarawa, one of a group of coral atolls about 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) north-east of Sydney.\nThe cargo included rice and tinned food.\nNone of the passengers or crew had been injured in the fire and the only problem on board was likely to be boredom given the ship\'s video players were out of action. "With no videos, they\'ll be a bit bored," Kumkee said.\nMost of the passengers were sitting or sleeping under canvas on blankets on the deck, he said.\nThey would be reduced to playing cards and their guitars until their rescue, he added.\nThe MV Maasmond is registered in Kingstown in St Vincent and Grenadines, according to the Lloyds List, and has had engine trouble in the past.\nIn 1992, it underwent engine repairs for ten weeks after encountering cyclones on a cruise through the Pacific.\n'

a(S'Gaming and electronics group AWA Ltd said on Wednesday it wanted to buy up to 75 percent of the New South Wales government-owned betting agency, the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB), later this year.\nAWA managing director John Rouse told Reuters in an interview that the company was looking at the option of a major recapitalisation to fund such an acquisition, which has been estimated to be worth around A$750 million.\n"It\'s clear that AWA has a strong interest in participating in the privatisation of the TAB," Rouse said.  \nHe said the racing industry and AWA were looking closely at the model used to privatise the Victorian TAB, where the industry bought a 25 percent stake and 75 percent was privatised through Tabcorp Holdings Ltd.\nAWA was considering the option of a major capital raising to fund the outright purchase of a 75 percent stake through a government trade sale, with an offer of a portion of the stake to the public later on.  \n"You could have a situation where initially the capital raising is funded by financial institutions and maybe AWA\'s existing shareholder base, but within a period a portion of what has been acquired would be floated on a broader basis to the public," Rouse said.\nThe Labor government in New South Wales has yet to say publicly whether it would privatise the TAB, but is expected to announce within several months a plan to sell it either through a public float or a trade sale.  \nBidders however wanted the government to give some concrete assurances about the tax and licensing regime a privatisated TAB would face.\n"It\'s important that the parameters in terms of tax and licensing are cast in concrete for some reasonable time," Rouse said.\nAWA was aware of a desire within government and the wider public that the public be offered shares in any privatised NSW TAB at some stage, he added.\n"We would be prepared to make commitments to the government that we would float it later on," he said.  \nRouse said there was a feeling within government and the racing industry that a trade sale would be preferable to a float.\n"There are those that are close to this issue in government saying if New South Wales wants to deal with this matter quickly, if the racing industry wants to establish its financial arrangements sooner rather than later and the government doesn\'t want the costs of a public float, than a tender needs to be the preferred approach," he said.  \nAWA\'s share price closed down two cents at 91 cents on Wednesday.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'Dairy and fruit juice group National Foods Ltd said on Tuesday its reforms announced in July were now almost fully completed and the group was poised for above-budget profit growth in the next six to nine months.\n"It\'s almost fully implemented," outgoing National Foods managing director Graham Reaney told Reuters in an interview.\n"The real benefits start to emerge as people become more familiar with the new structures and clearly there\'ll be gains over the next six to nine months," Reaney said.  \nEarlier on Tuesday National Foods posted a 17.3 percent higher operating profit before tax of A$37.6 million for the year to June 30.\nIts net profit rose to A$15.05 million from A$10.77 million after an abnormal loss of A$7.89 million.\nNet profit before abnormals rose to A$22.7 million from A$19.2 million, against analysts\' expectations of about A$23 million.\nNational Foods said in announcing its results, earnings for July and August were ahead of budget and comfortably ahead of last year.  \nReaney repeated that this meant that 1996/97 profits were likely to be higher than in 1995/96, but he would not say how much higher. "But its clearly going in the right direction."\nThe reforms had created a more efficient distribution system for chilled foods, increasing sales coverage for National Foods\' products, Reaney said.\n"It\'s a combination of cost reduction and enhanced distribution, and looking at our beverage division, our flavoured milks are performing particularly strongly," he said.\n"There are a number of areas that starting to perform a lot better for us."  \nReaney said the sale of non-core assets had also been completed and the company was now focused on extracting profit growth from existing assets.\n"We would consider all businesses that we have today as core businesses," he said, adding, however, that he could not rule out future acquisitions.\n"But the first objective to make those assets that we currently own work better, produce more profit, more cash flow."\nSingapore\'s Camerlin Pte Ltd has about eight percent of National Foods and Hong Kong\'s Mingly Corp has about 10.4 percent of the company.  \nReaney said he would not comment on shareholders\' intentions or actions or whether either of the Asian-based investors planned any takeover or had brought on any board room reshuffle.\nHe said he had resigned the managing director\'s position having worked for the company for five years. "Five to seven years is a normal period for a chief executive and quite genuinely I do have other things to do," he said.\n"I\'m quite relaxed and if it wasn\'t an amicable arrangement I wouldn\'t be staying on as a non-executive director," he said on his last day in the job.  \nReaney\'s replacement, Max Ould, was chief executive of Peters Foods until April and presided over the transfer of operations from Pacific Dunlop Ltd to Nestle Australia.\nNational Foods\' shares closed up three cents at A$1.41.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'World-wide Australian transport group TNT Ltd reported another annual profit slump on Wednesday, but promised the sale of its troubled airline and other reforms would produce strong profit growth in current year.\n"We haven\'t got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we\'re starting from," TNT managing director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.  \nTNT\'s net profit for the year to June 30 fell to A$9.84 million (US$7.79 million) from A$40.01 million in 1994/95 and A$105.05 million in 1993/94.\nMortimer said a sharp drop profits from Australia\'s Ansett Airlines, 50 percent owned by TNT, and losses from its Brazilian operations and local general freight business offset good revenue growth in TNT\'s core operations.\nHe said profits from these core activities of domestic and international time sensitive freight and logistics had grown 48.7 percent to A$165.3 million in 1995/96.  \nTNT had moved to excise these loss-making units and focus on profitable core activities, he said.\n"We\'ve dealt with the (Australian) LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that\'s been closed, and we\'ve sold Brazil," he said.\n"What\'s the saying ... when in doubt shoot it or fix it."\nTNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said.\n"We\'ve got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don\'t perform then they will be vulnerable to sale," he said.  \n"The inconsistency in our results has come from these fringe activities ... it\'s that volatility around the earnings base that says we have to concentrate on core activities and get out of the non-core \'riff-raff\' if you like," he said.\nTNT announced earlier this week the finalisation of plans to sell its stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd for cash receipts of A$325 million. The other 50 percent of Ansett is owned by Rupert Murdoch\'s News Corp Ltd.  \nTNT\'s remaining non-core activities include an airline leasing company jointly owned with News Corp, some shipping operations between New Zealand and Australia, a mono-rail in Sydney and some information technology assets.\nMortimer would not single out any as potential immediate sale prospects, but said they were vulnerable while they were not making profits.\nHe said the airline leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide, needed to have its capital base restructured before it could be sold.  \nShareholders however took the profit slump in their stride, having actually forecast a slight loss, rather than a slight profit.\nNet profit before abnormals, but after preference dividends, fell to A$0.6 million from A$38.48 million in 1994/95.\nAnalysts had expected a pre-abnormal, post preferences loss of between A$4 million and A$22 million.\nTNT\'s shares closed up three cents at A$1.47.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'Electronic payment systems company Intellect Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday its bid for Internet software firm Techway Ltd would allow it to launch a product for making secure payments on the Internet.\nIntellect, which helped pioneer EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer Point of Sale) technology and systems in Australia, wanted to export Techway\'s software in conjunction with its own secure electronic payments systems, Intellect executive chairman Ross Leighton told Reuters.  \nIntellect already sold its EFTPOS hardware and software to 20 banks outside Australia and to five or six large banks in Europe, all of whom were investigating its use with the Internet.\n"All banks are looking for greater service and lower costs and the internet is the way to do that," Leighton said in an interview.\nFinding a user-friendly and secure way of making payments and money transfers on the internet has become something of a holy grail for programmers.  \nSecure payments systems are seen dramatically increasing the volume of financial transactions made on the net, which are already growing strongly.\nTechway\'s Web Australia unit built the software currently being used for internet banking by Advance Bank Ltd, which is merging with St George Bank Ltd.\nIntellect announced late on Monday it would make a takeover offer for Techway Ltd in a counter-bid to a previous offer by Nova Pacific Capital Ltd.\nIntellect said it will offer one of its shares for every 2-1/2 Techway shares. The bid values Techway at A$4.9 million.  \nTechway, who had already signed a distribution agreement with Intellect, has recommended shareholders accept the bid.\nLeighton said the success of Techway\'s software on the Advance Bank site was a key factor in Intellect\'s decision to launch a takeover bid.\nAdvance\'s Internet banking site is Australia\'s most successful and has been consistently rated amoung the world\'s top ten internet banking sites by The Money Pages, an Internet magazine that rates internet sites.  \nAdvance Bank spokesman David Brown said the Techway-designed site had 10,000 regular customers who used the site for about 10,000 transactions a week.\nThe site was picking up 150 new customers a week and each internet transaction cost the bank less than 10 cents, while an over the counter transaction cost about A$2.50, he said.\n"The collaboration between Techway and Advance was a key for Advance getting the jump on our competitors," Brown said.\nIntellect\'s Leighton said Techway\'s headstart in Australia meant it had a good chance of becoming the industry standard for Internet transactions in Australia.  \n"It has the ability to become a defacto standard in Australia," Leighton said.\nThe marriage of Techway\'s secure transaction software and Intellect\'s EFTPOS hardware and systems would help accelerate the trend of convergence evident in recent years between debit cards, credit cards and EFTPOS, he said.\n"As these different payments come together, you\'ll then see they\'ll be able to be more economically utilised over the Internet."  \nIntellect\'s share price closed down three cents at 95 cents on Tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of A$48.19 million.\nTechway\'s shares closed up 5.5 cents at 37 cents.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n'

a(S'Australasian food group Goodman Fielder Ltd is expected to report a slightly higher annual net profit before abnormals early on Thursday, as firmer margins in some areas are seen largely offset by higher grain costs.\n"I\'ll be looking for some margin growth, but also there\'s been some strong raw materials cost increases," one Sydney analyst said, adding he was forecasting a pre-abnormals net profit of just under A$100 million.  \nThe median forecast in BZW Australia\'s Barceps survey of analysts was for a A$100.0 million pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30, 1996.\nForecasts ranged from A$97.0 million to A$102.3 million, compared with the A$97.3 million profit posted in 1994/95.\n"There\'ll be a big impact from the grain prices in the second half and going into the first half of this (1996/97 year)," another Sydney analyst said, estimating extra grain costs of about A$60 million.  \nBut analysts expected the cost of grain, a major input in Goodman\'s breadmaking and chicken operations, would ease back later in calendar 1996.\nThe higher grain costs were likely to have been offset somewhat in the second half of 1995/96 by lower packaging and palm oil costs, some analysts said.\nProfit expectations are in a tight band in part because of Goodman\'s own comments about the result in early August.\nGoodman chief executive David Hearn said then that the pre-abnormal profit would be around A$100 million.  \n"We\'re saying that there will be a small increase in pre-abnormal profit in the 0-5 percent range from last year and since we made A$97 million last year, zero to five means somewhere between A$97 and A$102 million," Hearn said.\nGoodman then also announced it would post abnormal losses of up to A$75 million in 1995/96, including a revaluation of its loss-making poultry operations.\nThis would produce a net profit after abnormals of around A$25 million, Hearn said then.  \nAnalysts said however most of the interest would be centred on Goodman\'s strategic plans for recovery from its profit slump of recent years.\nGoodman Fielder shares closed down a cent at A$1.31 on Wednesday.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

a(S'Transport and logistics group TNT Ltd said on Wednesday it was well placed for quite strong profit growth in the current 1996/97 year, but would continue to look at selling its currently unprofitable non-core assets.\n"We haven\'t got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we\'re starting from," TNT Managing Director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.  \nMortimer said the non-core activities that slowed down TNT\'s earnings in 1995/96 were its general freight business in Australia and its Brazilian operations.\n"We\'ve dealt with the LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that\'s been closed and we\'ve sold Brazil," he said.\n"What\'s the saying...when in doubt shoot it or fix it."\nTNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said.\n"We\'ve got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don\'t perform then they will be vulnerable to sale," he said.  \nOne of those non core activities is TNT\'s 50 percent interest in airliner leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide. News Corp Ltd owns the other half.\nMortimer said he had consistently said that Ansett Worldwide\'s capital base needed to be restructured to give it cheaper access to capital so it could compete properly.\n"In its present structure, it\'s difficult for it to be optimised for News and TNT ownership because it needs access to capital at an effective rate," he said.\nNews and TNT continued to look at ways of restructuring Ansett Worldwide\'s capital base before selling it, he said.  \nAnsett\'s GD Express operation based in Europe had turned around in the last year and was now going well, Mortimer said.\nHe said the just completed sale plans for Ansett Airlines\nMortimer said in the longer term, TNT aimed to get double digit revenue and earnings growth.\n"Overall we\'d like to do good double digit (revenue and earnings) growth, but we can\'t guarantee any of that," he said.\nTNT\'s share price closed up three cents at A$1.47.\n-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'

News\' shares fell 16 cents to A$6.60 in the hours after the result.\n"It\'s about A$20 million less than what the market would have liked and to still reach that (20 percent profit growth) outlook, it\'s got to make up the difference in the second half," the Sydney analyst said.  \nNews had said in August last year when it posted a A$1.26 billion net profit for the year to June 30, 1996 that it expected strong movie and television revenues to increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97.\nMurdoch repeated the forecast in October, but the group has been publicly tight-lipped about it since then and its first quarter results were also lower than expected.\nHowever News reassured the analysts in a teleconference briefing after the first half result, saying that it was still on track for the 20 percent profit growth.\nThe profit forecast was not in the formal release.  \n"They did say that they\'re still on track for the 20 percent growth," another Sydney media analyst said after the morning teleconference briefing between company officials and U.S. and Australian analysts.\nAnalysts said News Corp officials were bullish about catching up in the second half and had pointed to the continued strong outlook for movies, U.S. television and newspapers.\nOperating income from News\' Fox Filmed Entertainment unit surged to A$202 million for the first half from A$84 million a year earlier, due largely to Independence Day.  \n"U.S. results were led by Fox Filmed Entertainment which posted a 154 percent gain in operating profits reflecting the continued success of Independence Day," News Corp said.\nAnalysts said the re-release of Star Wars, among others, would help further boost movie revenues in the second half.\n"It\'s pure profit in the second half, whereas they had costs to write off in the first half," said another analyst.\nStrong revenues from News\' Fox television network and its Fox stations would also help second half profits.\n"They did very well over the Super Bowl and they\'ve got a new hit with King of the Hill," said an analyst.  \nU.K. newspapers would again perform well in the second half, analysts said. British newspaper profits rose 18 percent in the first half, with gains in circulation revenues at The Sun, the Times and The Sunday Times.\n"All of the company\'s newspapers have maintained their dominant position in each of their respective markets, despite cover price increases instituted during the quarter at both The Sun and The Times," News said.\nNews said losses at its burgeoning Asian satellite broadcaster Star TV were in line with expectations but no figures were released. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800\n'
