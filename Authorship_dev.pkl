(S'The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.\nThe National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.\nThe league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.\nThe site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.\n"Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information," said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch "has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy."\nIn May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.\nFraud reports from the league\'s site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.\nThe second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.\nIn third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.\nOther top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.\nThe League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.\n'

a(S'An influential Internet organisation has backed away from a proposal to dramatically expand the number of addresses available on the global computer network.\nThe Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, announced this week that instead of moving ahead with the proposal it would form a nine-member committee to study the issue.\nUnveiled in August, the proposal was an attempt to quell the growing number of disputes over desirable address names.\n"There has been considerable international debate on various aspects of the proposal with no consensus," Don Heath, president of the society, said in a statement. "It is in the best interest of the continued beneficial evolution of the Internet that these issues be aired and resolved."\nDisputes over Internet names are occuring with increasing frequency as more companies seek to publicise and market their products over the Net.\nFor example, Viacom Inc.\'s MTV cable music channel fought with one of its employees who had registered "mtv.com," eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.\nEvery site on the World Wide Web must have a unique address name. Most addresses end with one of a few three letter designations, known as top-level domains, including "com" for private sites, "gov for government sites and "edu" for sites run by schools.\nIn August, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority said it would oversee the creation of up to 150 new top level domains, easing the squeeze, especially for names in the private sector category.\nThe authority, operating under charter from the society and the Federal Network Council, is the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards.\nThe society\'s board of trustees voted in June to accept a preliminary version of the numbers authority proposal, with the proviso that the business aspects of proposal be fleshed out.\nBut with the ensuing controversy, the society decided a committee was needed to reexamine the proposal, Heath said.\nThe committee will include two members appointed by the society, two by the numbers authority and two by the Internet Architecure Board.\nThe International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association will each appoint one member.\n'

a(S'House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at remaking the regulatory landscape for banking and other financial services in the United States.\nA similiar bill Leach introduced in the previous Congress foundered last June amid opposition from the insurance industry and House Democrats.  \nAnalysts have said this year\'s bill might have a better chance of passage, but that was before Leach decided to oppose Newt Gingrich\'s reelection as Speaker of the House, a move that could turn the leadership against his bill.\n"This bill provides expanded powers for the banking, securities and insurance industries," Leach said in a statement. "The ultimate beneficiaries of this legislation, however, are consumers."  \n"Not only will there be more products available to banking customers who are looking to maximize their savings, but efficiencies should lower industry costs and therefore costs to consumers," Leach said.\nIf passed, the bill would break down the legal barriers enacted after the Great Depression between banks, securities firms and insurance companies.\nBank regulators have already begun eroding the barriers for banks, putting pressure on Congress to level the playing field, analysts said.  \nThe Federal Reserve voted Dec 20 to allow bank subsidiaries to garner a greater share of revenue from underwriting activity. And a month earlier, the Comptroller of the Currency\'s office said it would allow banks to enter an array of non-bank markets.\nLeach said his bill would repeal Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act and amend Section 32 to allow for the merger of commercial and investment banks.  \nBank subsidiaries would be allowed to engage directly in securities dealing and other activities considered "part of and incidental to" banking. Affiliates of bank holding companies, would be allowed to engage in insurance activities as principal, agent or broker.\nThe bill would also abolish the federal charter for thrifts while grandfathering existing thrift holding companies. National thrifts would have the option of transferring to a national or state bank charter or a state savings and loan charter.\nThe Iowa Republican\'s bill would continue to prohibit commercial companies outside the finance sector from owning banks.\nThe bill was also sponsored by three other Republican members of the Banking Committee: Rep Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Mike Castle of Delaware and Rick Lazio of New York.\nThe full committee will hold hearings on the bill and any related legislation in early March, Leach said.\nThe text of Leach\'s bill is available under the "daily update" section of the Banking Committee\'s World Wide Web site, http://www.house.gov/banking/.\n((202-898-8312))\n'

a(S'The debate over reforming America\'s financial services sector, a top priority for Congress and the Clinton administration, began in earnest Tuesday.\nAs major industry representatives sat down at a House Banking subcommitee hearing on two pending reform bills, word came that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D\'Amato, R.-N.Y., had introduced his own version of comprehensive reform.\nThe bills introduced so far, as well as an administration proposal expected late next month, begin with the same premise: the time is right to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act enacted during the Depression to separate banking from other financial activities like securities underwriting and insurance.\nMost in Congress agree. And, for the first time, most financial service company seem to agree as well.\nAt the hearing of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, representatives of banking, insurance, securities and mutual funds all agreed Congress should allow a single entity to span all financial services businesses.\nBut, as subcommittee Chairwoman Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, observed, "The devil is in the details."\nThose who had opposed tearing down Glass-Steagall, mainly insurance and securities companies, have seen federal courts and regulators slowly roll back the law -- but only for banks.\nLast March, the Supreme Court freed banks from many state insurance restrictions.\nThe Federal Reserve also decided to allow banks to derive up to 25 percent of a subsidiary\'s revenue from securities activity, an increase from the previous limit of 10 percent. In November, the comptroller of the currency said he would start allowing national banks to enter a host of non-banking businesses.\nBanks got substantial new authority, but others got nothing.\n"For too long, important policy issues have been addressed by regulatory agencies or the courts rather than by Congress," Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Vice President Roy Albertalli testified at the hearing. Albertalli spoke on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurance, which had opposed mixing banks and insurance.\nAll the proposals before Congress would level the playing field to some degree and recognise the changes that have shaken modern finance.\n"This banking reform legislation will reform the current patchwork of laws and allow the market to operate freely within the financial services industry," D\'Amato said as he introduced his bill.\nWhile a broad consensus has been achieved, several important issues remain to be addressed. Perhaps the most controversial is the extent to which non-financial companies should be allowed to own or be owned by financial companies.\nUnder existing law, mutual funds, insurance companies and savings and loans can combine with so-called commercial firms while banks cannot.\nSmaller banks and consumer groups staunchly oppose mixing the two, which would be permitted under the D\'Amato bill, limited under the Roukema bill and forbidden under a bill introduced by House Banking Chairman Jim Leach, R.-Iowa.\nJoseph Bracewell of the Indepedent Bankers Association of America laid out the opposition. Citing former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Bracewell said such mergers could "distort lending decisions, be anticompetitive and threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system.\nBanks said they could live with Roukema\'s compromise approach, but were undecided about the D\'Amato plan. Others heartily endorsed the unlimited approach.\nMutual funds have been "knee-deep in affiliations" and "they\'ve never proved a problem in 57 years," said Matt Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute.\nDifferences also remain regarding regulation of new, diversified financial services companies, although most favoured an approach having various, specialised agencies regulate the relevent portion of each firm\'s activities.\n'

a(S'Internet access providers and others who met with Net-savvy lawmakers said they fear Congress will wreak havoc on cyberspace but are also heartened by the growing number of legislators who understand the global computer network.\nCompany representatives met Tuesday night at the Capitol with members of the Congressional Internet Caucus, about 85 legislators with a common interest in the Net, to express their hopes and fears about efforts to make laws governing cyberspace.\n"I think it\'s inevitable that there will be bills introduced that attempt to legislate the content of everything on the Internet," Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&amp;T Corp.\'s WorldNet Internet service, said after the meeting.\nEvslin said it would be as difficult to keep Congress from making wrong moves as it would be to get the legislature to act to head off problems.\nBill Schrader, president of Internet provider PSINet Inc., was more blunt. "Be very careful or you will destroy this industry," he warned.\nThe members of Congress who attended the meeting pledged to try to protect the Internet.\n"We have a lot of pretty tough work ahead of us," Representative Rick White, R-Pa., and a co-chairman of the caucus conceded. "We have many, many issues coming down the pike from encryption to privacy, to copyright and taxation."\nEncyrption is the use of software to encode and decode information.\nSen. Conrad Burns, also a co-chairman, warned that, despite the caucus, legislation will always trail developments in the private sector.\n"The government making policy is never ahead of the curve," the Montana Republican said. "If we do the right thing now, I guarantee you that by the time it\'s passed and the president signs it, we\'ll be behind the curve."\nLast year was a mixed bag for the Internet in Congress.\nLegislators passed the Communications Decency Act, opposed by online companies and civil libertarians as an infringement on free speech rights, but also defeated measures that would have imposed liability on Internet providers for copyright infringement.\nSun Microsystems Inc.\'s chief scientist, John Gage, fretted that, with only 85 pro-Internet legislators out of 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate, most in Congress remained ignorant of the Net. "We\'ve got a long way to go," he said.\nCompanies interested in the Internet offered some conflicting goals for Congress. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, urged the legislators to impose new laws protecting Hollywood products.\n"Congress cannot avoid that all intellectual property has to be protected -- this can\'t be Dodge City without a sheriff," Valenti said. But he also praised the Internet as "the most valuable and spacious information greenhouse that\'s ever been built."\nPSINet\'s Schrader countered that existing laws already protected movies, books and other works. "Everything is not new," he said. "It\'s the same-old, same-old."\n'

a(S'Germany\'s David Prinosil ended rising British star Tim Henman\'s bid for his first ATP Tour victory on Saturday, while Czech Petr Korda halted compatriot Martin Damm\'s quest for his second final appearance in two weeks.\nPrinosil beat Henman 6-4 6-3 in the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open and Korda followed with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 victory against his Davis Cup team mate.\nSeventh seed Henman, who had not lost a set all week, looked shaky on his groundstrokes early, but stayed in contention with his strong serve, firing seven of his 11 aces in the first set.\nBut in the 10th game of the match, Henman\'s serve failed him, his double fault giving the German triple break point.\nHenman, who has now reached seven semifinals but never gone further, fought back with a service winner and then an ace, but as he has done all week, Prinosil blasted a brilliant return to take the point and set.\nThe British number one recovered to gain two break points of his own in the third game, but failed to come up big when he needed to.\nPrinosil, who was born near here in Olomouc before emigrating to Germany, then took control.\nHenman said: "I didn\'t serve well at the right times. I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn\'t really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office.\n"I\'m disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I\'ve played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris."\nPrinosil said: "I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me."\nDamm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week\'s march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played.\nVictimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich.\nFor Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches.\nThe former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings.\n"I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I\'ve never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level," said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.\n'

a(S'Germany\'s David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday.\nThe 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes.\nAs was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes.\nIt was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year.\nKorda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes.  \n"If someone told me I wouldn\'t lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don\'t think I have ever played this well," said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.\nKorda said: "I was a little drained from yesterday\'s match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match."\nKorda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes.\n'

a(S'The Prague Stock Exchange suffered one of its biggest one-day falls on Friday as foreign interest waned because of a lack of market transparency.\nFour of the PSE\'s five largest issues fell sharply in active trading, pulling the Reuters RPIX index down nearly three percent to 1,052.\nLong-criticised for its lack of transparency and regulation, analysts say Friday\'s loss was yet another sign that investors, especially foreigners, are pulling out of the market having grown tired of failed promises of reform.\n"There\'s just a total lack of interest in this market," said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.\n"Fundamentally, companies look pretty cheap, but the lack of foreign interest and Czechs fearing the possibility of a devaluation and looking abroad (mean) you don\'t have that much buying interest."\nUnder the Czech Republic\'s Securities Act, which was devised to handle the logistics of the government\'s massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.\nSince the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process.\nThe problems have restrained the PSE which sees on average $4-$6 million of stock changing hands each day, compared with $15 million turnover in Warsaw, where the market has a capitalisation of just $3 billion.\n"Unambiguously, a notable portion of foreign investors are not satisified with the current state of the Czech capital market," said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.\nIn April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.\nThe PSE has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, but some analysts say that the process is taking too long.\nIn mid-September, the Prague Stock Exchange pledged to improve the state of the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog.\nBut many analysts were disappointed by the lack of strong enforcement requirements, as market supervision is still kept in the hands of a small, under-resourced Finance Ministry department.\nAnd some question whether there is even the political will here to change the market, or if a few regulations will be enough to change the attitude of many market participants.\n"The problem isn\'t only with market regulations. I don\'t feel the political will which can bring change and prevent frauds.," Markus Winkler, manager of the Discover Europe Investment Fund was quoted in the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes as saying on Friday.\n'

a(S'The party of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took a solid lead in Senate election run-offs on Saturday, but turnout was dismal despite an appeal to vote from President Vaclav Havel.\nWith almost half the 81 constituencies declared, Klaus\'s Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had won 19 seats in the new upper house, ahead of the opposition Social Democrats with eight.\nThe Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus\'s centre-right coalition, put in a strong perfomance to take seven while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won two.\nTurnout was just 30.5 percent, lower even than the 35 percent recorded in the first round of the Senate polls on November 15 and 16, the Central Election Commission said.\nBefore the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house.\nThe Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus\'s coalition, which lost its lower house majority in elections six months ago. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance.\nFinance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, an ODS member, forecast that the government parties would take control of the Senate.\n"It is clear that the coalition is leading at the moment and I think they still will be after the final results are out," Kocarnik told reporters, predicting that the ODS would win between 33 and 40 seats.\nAnalysts had forecast that voter apathy would benefit the ODS which is well-organised and well-funded by big business.\nIts supporters, largely more affluent Czechs who have benefited from Klaus\'s free market reforms since the 1989 fall of communism, have been galvanised by the coalition\'s loss of its majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies in June.\nKlaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the little-reformed communists to turn back the clock on reform.\nScepticism is widespread among Czechs and Klaus himself has questioned the need for the Senate, which was written into the Czech Republic\'s new constitution when Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992, but is only now being elected.\nThe Social Democrats have said they would scrap the Senate if they ever achieved the three-fifths majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies needed to change the constitution.\nKlaus toned down his scepticism as voting neared but only Havel has appeared enthusiastic about the idea.\nBefore the run-offs -- for the top two first round candidates in constituencies where no one won more than half the vote -- Havel appealed to citizens to turn out in much greater numbers for the sake of the Senate\'s legitimacy.\n-- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n'

a(S'Markets across Eastern Europe remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts seeing little on the horizon to break the bearish trend.\nStock exchanges in Bratislava, Bucharest, and Zagreb all lost ground on the week, while Prague and Warsaw held steady. Budapest and Ljubljana bucked the trend, rising slightly, although it appeared neither would see a sustained upturn in the near future.\nPRAGUE\nNot even a strong showing by the centre-right governing coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the Prague Stock Exchange out of its current malaise, as the PX50 index inched up 0.3 points on the week to close at 510.4.\nAnalysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little power, investors remain put off by poor market regulation.\n"I\'m a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring changes to the market," said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.\n"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic."\nInvestors have long complained that market regulation and legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little protection for minority shareholders.\nWARSAW\nThe Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week and analysts said it could extend its three-and-a-half-week horizontal trend next week as no fresh signals were in sight.\n"We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market," said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.\nBut other analysts saw the generally positive economic climate as an impulse strong enough to help the bourse climb next week above 14,000 points.\nAnalysts said the central bank deputy head\'s Tuesday comment on a possible rise in interest rates next year was bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to signficantly hurt prices.\nBUDAPEST\nHungarian shares started off the weekend strongly, boosted by a government decision to hike energy prices, but they ran out of steam by the middle of the week.\nOil and gas company MOL led the charge, but dealers said its weakening on Thursday could be a harbinger.\n"MOL turned around today (on Thursday), that is a warning sign," said New York Broker\'s Kalman Schuszter.

a(S'Britain\'s Halifax Building Society is confident of avoiding any takeover attempts once it sheds its mutual status and becomes a publicly quoted bank in June next year, a senior official said on Thursday.\n"We think we can stand on our own feet," David Gilchrist, Halifax\'s director of corporate affairs said in a telephone interview following the announcement of the timetable for the planned conversion and 10 billion stg flotation.\nThe building society\'s nine million members -- its savers and borrowers -- will vote on the conversion early next year.  \nGilchrist said the building society\'s decision to convert by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose a five-year protection against takeover.\nIt will also increase the voting threshold needed to give the plans the go-ahead. But he was confident that it would achieve a sufficiently high vote in favour, of at least 50 percent of all investing members entitled to vote.\n"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned," he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.  \n"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing," Gilchrist said.\nEarlier, the Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme in January 1997. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.\nGilchrist said members would get a "broad idea" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.  \nHe also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs.\n"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail," he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote "as quickly as possible" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.  \n"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares," he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nBut it was working on the basis that a "large number" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added.\nThose who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.\nIf eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they "may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n'

a(S'The "Big Bang" maintained London as one of the world\'s financial hubs, but 10 years on the role of specialised financial "boutiques" at the heart of the City is under mounting pressure from huge integrated investment banks.\n"The wonderful time that there has been for the small boutique since Big Bang is over. The days of the single violinist are past, it\'s time for the full orchestra," one banking source told Reuters.\nThe so-called Big Bang of 1986 brought about radical reforms in the way the London Stock Exchange and the British government bond market operated, principally by allowing mergers between merchant banks, brokers and stock jobbers.\nIt saw the demise of traditional names such as Wedd Durlacher Mordaunt and Phillips and Drew which became parts of Barclays\' investment bank BZW and of UBS respectively.\nAnd ever since the initial wave of changes investment banking giants with global aspirations have been hoovering up small players which have carved out a niche for themselves.\nU.S. EXPERIENCE SETS THE PACE\nIn the world of corporate finance this pattern of smaller firms being swallowed up by the large players is set to mirror what has taken place in the U.S., corporate financiers say.\n"I believe the world is moving away from small nimble-footed boutiques, which had a wonderful time under the Conservative government. The new world is going to be based around very big cross-border corporate finance. You need a very big broking arm behind you," one corporate financier said.\nThis need for broking capacity and a dwindling number of independent brokers, combined with increasing regulatory demands for capital, has shrunk the opportunities for boutiques. Even in the growing derivatives market, the amounts of capital needed to play the global markets mean small outfits are hard to sustain.\nBOUTIQUES THREATENED BY EUROPE INTEGRATION\nApart from the possibility of an opposition Labour government and perhaps greater restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, with the need for companies to prove that a takeover is in the public interest, the other threat to corporate finance boutiques comes from European integration.\nIncreased bureaucracy and more rigorous European Commission demands on the companies involved in takeovers will mean even greater research capabilities and legal back-up are required by the financiers advising companies on such deals, bankers say.\n"Boutiques won\'t be much good if you have got to take a huge team of analysts and brokers out to Brussels every time you are planning a deal," said one.\nWith U.S. investment banking mammoths such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch building increasing roles in corporate finance as well as their traditional broking and trading strengths, this is also putting pressure on the small corporate finance players.\nHAMBRO MAGAN FALLS TO NATIONAL WESTMINSTER\nA recent casualty is J Hambro Magan, which two weeks ago was sold to NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain\'s National Westminster Bank, for an estimated 80 million pounds ($127.3 million).\nThe prominent corporate finance boutique was set up by George Magan in 1988 and has been involved in some of the biggest mergers and acquisitions in Britain in recent years.\n"The new world is going to be dominated by the very big boys," another banker said.\nSome commentators say the future of small boutiques is not as bleak as it may appear. They see the demise of some as merely part of a cycle which will spawn new dynamic teams based around talented individuals who may decide to leave a large established firm, take clients and expertise with them, and go it alone.\n"It\'s an on-going process. It\'s always postulated every time there\'s a rash of takeovers that boutiques are going out of fashion. But it\'s the same process as Big Bang. Small firms have developed since. Some have disappeared and been replaced by others," a banking analyst at one U.S. investment bank said.\nIn cases such as Hambro Magan, the cycle has turned full circle, with the key individuals making significant financial gains for themselves by selling a highly successful business at its peak and coming back into the folds of a larger player.\nSMALL FIRMS CAN SELL PERSONALISED SERVICE\nBut while small firms will never compete for the truly global roles, there is still a place for the personalised localised service offered by boutiques. "There\'s always a demand for that type of service," he added.\nOthers agree that in a world where investment banks are attempting to become so-called "one-stop shops", the pressures to sell clients an entire package of products could in fact enhance the position of boutiques, whose advice is perhaps more truly independent as they don\'t have other axes to grind.\nDRESDNER KLEINWORT BUYS LUTHY BAILLIE\nAnother boutique to have fallen prey to a multi-national banking player with plenty of capital behind it, sophisticated trading and broking operations and global ambitions is the bond specialist Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick &amp; Co.\nIt was snapped up only two weeks ago by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking division of Germany\'s second largest commercial bank Dresdner Bank.\nPeter Luthy, one of the founders of the 15-person bond boutique which was set up in 1990, said the firm\'s reliance on a market undergoing significant changes because of the interest rate environment and the constraints of size had forced it to seek embrace of a larger partner.\n"We learned a hell of a lot. But our business skills are better used in a big firm. The opportunities are better in a big firm," Luthy told Reuters recently.\nSuch changes will not necessarily end with the small firms such as Luthy\'s. Banking analysts and corporate financiers alike have for some time been predicting the days are numbered for what one called the "super-boutiques".\nThis dwindling list of traditional British merchant banks includes Cazenoves, NM Rothschilds, Hambros, Schroders and Robert Fleming. Takeovers here are complicated in some cases by family holdings, but strategic alliances have been suggested as an acceptable alternative in order to compete globally.\n"I think even the super-boutiques are going to be struggling over the next five years," the first banking source said.

a(S'Top managers in major financial firms need to be razor-sharp if the world\'s increasingly complex markets are to run smoothly, however sophisticated the regulatory regime, regulators and politicians said on Thursday.\n"Management needs to know its business. (It) sets the ethos of the company," Alistair Darling, spokesman on treasury affairs for Britain\'s opposition Labour party told a conference on financial regulation and minimising systemic risk.\nExamples of where rules had been broken by so-called "rogue traders" were a clear sign of management failure, he said.\nChristine Cumming, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also voiced doubts about management\'s current ability to deal with regulatory problems.\nThe health of an institution lay in its management and directors, but they were not necessarily properly armed to deal with problems when they arose, she said.\n"Do we prepare directors and managers enough?" Cumming said.\nBritain\'s often criticised regulatory system, which relies heavily on so-called "self-regulation," is also under scrutiny.\nDarling said that whichever party won the next general election, due by May 1997, the British regulatory system "will be reformed." But this would not mean "tearing everything up or dramatic change," he added.\nHe said Labour wanted to establish a regulator with sufficient "clout reputation and stature" to deal with its international counterparts.\nBut it would not create a "Super-SIB," an enlarged version of the top regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), as some commentators have suggested. A Labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulations.\nDarling\'s call for minimising the regulatory burden by making it as cost-effective as possible was echoed by most of the speakers at the conference.\nAngela Knight, Britain\'s economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wants to see a cost-benefit analysis applied to all regulations. If they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopted, she said.\nKnight also underlined the dramatic effect on the industry as a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank Barings in February 1995 was "a more salutory lesson than any regulation" to other banks and financial institutions.\nThere were calls from both politicians for interchange between industry and the regulators, so that the experiences on either side of the fence could be carried across by individuals.\nBut while the idea of the regulators being staffed by people with first-hand industry knowledge won support from many of those attending the meeting, the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movements was seen by some as a serious obstacle to this system spreading.\nAnd while regulators need to keep up with rapid changes in financial instruments and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale, they can never be expected to be one step ahead of the business they are monitoring.\n"Regulators should respond to business realities rather than be ahead of business trends," Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB told the meeting.\nThis would mean regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated to cope with the changing business environment and having to co-operate more and more with their counterparts in other countries.\n"The next generation of supervisors will have to evaluate far more complex information and make far more complex judgements," Large said.\n'

a(S'Members of the Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G) at Tradeteam, the distribution arm of the brewing operation of Britain\'s Bass Plc, are to vote on strike action over proposed pay cuts, the union said on Friday.\nThe union said in a statement that the ballot of more than 1,000 workers at Tradeteam would start on December 9 and the result would be known on December 20.\nBass said there was no threat to the delivery of drinks to its customers in the run up to the busy Christmas period.\nThe T&amp;G said the ballot was going ahead after an attempt by Tradeteam, a joint venture between Bass and NFC, to have it halted by a legal injunction failed on Friday.\n"Since Bass established Tradeteam in a joint venture with Exel Logistics, management has been trying to cut wages by 100 stg per week and impose inferior working conditions in order to save 10 million stg a year," the union said.\nIt said Tradeteam had also rejected T&amp;G attempts to establish national bargaining. The T&amp;G said a Liverpool judge had refused to grant an injunction to stop the ballot.\n"Bass Brewers Ltd is a very profitable company, which made over 157 million pounds profit over the last year. Their aim at Tradeteam has been to cut the wages of draymen and warehouse workers, many of whom have given over 20 years\' loyal service to the company," T&amp;G national secretary for the drinks industry Brian Revell said.\nDraymen deliver beer and other drinks to pubs.\n"I am pleased that the judge refused the injunction. We are prepared for a long battle with Bass until it honours its responsibilities," he added.\nA spokesman for Tradeteam, which is 50.1 percent owned by NFC, denied a trade dispute existed with the union.\n"There is no trade dispute with the T&amp;G. Current settlements on pay and conditions between Tradeteam and its staff represented by the T&amp;G have been made with full agreement of the T&amp;G at local branch level," he told Reuters.\n"To agree to national wage agreements would mean Tradeteam would be totally out of step with the rest of the industry."\nHe said the union had been involved throughout the consultation process. This had resulted in the current terms and conditions for staff at each of the local offices at which the T&amp;G was represented, he added.\nBass Brewers said the decision to vote on strike action would not affect beer deliveries over Christmas.\n"Obviously the strike issue is one for Tradeteam but we want to reassure customers this will not affect their beer deliveries during or before the Christmas period," Stewart Cain of Bass Brewers told Reuters.\nEarlier this week brewer-to-leisure group Bass, the parent company, said it planned to spend 670 million pounds on the business next year, creating some 7,000 jobs.\nIt said it planned a 300 million pounds investment programme over the next year on its Bass Taverns, converting many pubs to branded concept bars.\n'

a(S'Former Barings executive Ron Baker plans to bring a counter-claim in a lawsuit against him by Dutch bank ING Barings for repayment of a loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.\n"He (Baker) plans to bring in his own counter-claim into those proceedings and they will be heard together unless some sort of arrangement is reached beforehand," Lindsay Hill, a partner at London law firm Fox Williams said.\nING Barings last month confirmed it was suing Baker for 113,000 pounds ($185,800), representing a 100,000 pound loan allegedly given to Baker when he was at Barings, plus interest.\nBritish merchant bank Barings collapsed in February 1995 amid losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. It was rescued by ING which formed ING Barings as its investment banking arm.\nLeeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank\'s downfall.\nBut the saga looks set to run on for some time, with writs filed by administrators of the bank against the former auditors and subsequent third party proceedings being issued against former bosses, including Baker.\nHill said Baker would contest the ING Barings case against him and his counter-claim would be for an unpaid bonus.\n"He believes that the monies that he was promised by way of bonus remain due and are outstanding so yes, they will come into the equation in terms of resolving the dispute with ING Barings," Hill said.\nBaker would not be the first to attempt to force ING Barings to pay a bonus which had apparently been promised before the collapse of Barings itself and ING\'s takeover.\nBut Hill said the decision by a London industrial tribunal on Thursday to reject a claim by another former Barings executive for an allegedly unpaid bonus had no implications for Baker\'s case.\n"It\'s a different case, it\'s for different sums of money and the circumstances are not the same," Hill said.\nMary Walz, who was global head of equity financial products at Barings Investment Bank, had her 500,000 pound claim, which she said she was told was "set in stone" by her former Barings bosses, thrown out by the tribunal.\nHill declined to say how much Baker\'s counter-claim would be for but said the sum was "substantial".\n'

a(S'After several shaky starts, Britain\'s commercial property market looks set to build on some improvement during 1996, but property experts stress there will not be a return to the sort of boom seen during the 1980s.\n"This is the "Real Thing\'. That is the growing opinion among investors when they consider the recovery now underway in the UK real estate market," said David Hutchings of property consultants Healey &amp; Baker in his 1997 outlook.\nHutchings predicts real rental growth of three percent in 1997 and possible total returns of 15-17 percent for institutional quality portfolios. This should outstrip the return on gilts and may surpass equity returns too, he adds.\nBut uncertainty ahead of a general election, which must be held by the end of May, means a "gradual but sustained upturn" is more likely than a market boom, he said.\nImproved signs of demand, particularly for office space in central London and retail developments, especially shopping centres, have raised expectations. "The feeling is generally that this year is going to be a good one," a senior property analyst at another leading firm of advisors told Reuters.\nThis view is supported by a recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and property consultants Grimley which was also cautiously bullish. It found increased business confidence meant a third of British firms expect to raise property holdings over the next six months.\nThe six-monthly survey, which canvassed 645 private sector firms across the range of sectors and regions in Britain, found 32 percent of companies expect to increase property holdings, 26 percent see a reduction and 41 envisage no change.\nNO DRAMATIC SURGE IN DEMAND\n"We expect a steady improvement rather than a dramatic surge in property requirements. The net balance on this survey is plus six percent over the next six months," Stuart Morley, Grimley\'s head of research, said last week.\nSudhir Junankar of the CBI said firms expect a further pick-up in business, led by domestic demand. "With profitability set to grow faster over the next six months, the upturn in the commercial property market is becoming more firmly based."\nThe CBI/Grimley survey predicts such growth will be strongest in the northwest of England, followed by Northern Ireland, Greater London and Scotland.\nLarger companies are expected to lead the charge with those involved in distribution, transport and communications citing expanding capacity as the main spur in giving the go-ahead to capital expenditure on property.\nThe survey found smaller firms, as well as those involved in metal manufacturing, chemical processing, finance and business services, said that increasing efficiency was the main factor influencing plans for investment in property.\nINTERESTED INVESTORS\nBut companies seeking additional or new space are not the only ones likely to fuel demand for real estate during 1997. Hutchings said the recovery underway in the property market is supported by both occupational and investment demand, in contrast to a brief upsurge during 1993.\nProperty consultant Knight Frank predicts that prime investment yields will be little changed in December from their levels in December 1996.\nIt forecasts the yield on City of London offices will be unchanged at 5.5 percent, while yields on offices in the area around London\'s M25 motorway and provincial towns will rise from 6.25 percent to 6.5 percent and from 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent respectively. In addition to offices, investors and property companies are particularly keen on shopping centres. "The prospects for the retail sector are good," the second analyst said.\nHutchings also forsees higher rents during the year ahead, fuelled by a growing economy, a shortage of top quality supply and low interest rates. Although some occupiers will hang back until after the election, occupational demand means rents will rise "at least until new development comes forward".\nSome development has already begun and Hutchings says there are now growing signs "that institutional funds will re-enter the speculative development market in 1997" although bank lending for such schemes remains tight.\nThis is not the case for other projects where bank loans are more readily available and competition to lend for quality developments has led to wafer-thin margins being charged by some banks, particularly German lenders.\nLONDON LEADS THE WAY\nWhile the number of cranes over the City of London -- London\'s traditional financial heartland -- has not mushroomed, development activity has begun to pick up and more can be expected over the next 12 months, market players said.\nIn London one very visible factor is the heated rivalry that has emerged between the City and Docklands, the former docks area to the east of the capital which is home to the Canary Wharf tower, London\'s tallest building.\nFirms such as U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch and Britain\'s Robert Fleming have still to decide on where to relocate, with others such as Close Brothers and Cazenove also rumoured to be in the hunt.\nAnd in the retail sector, last year\'s sale of former fashion mecca Carnaby Street by Dutch property fund Wereldehave for 90 million pounds "is a testament to the strength of investors\' faith in the London market", said Hutchings.\n'

a(S'The trial of prominent Chinese dissident and former student leader Wang Dan for the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government is expected to be held behind closed doors soon, a family member said on Tuesday.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People\'s Court had yet to inform Wang\'s family of the trial date, the relative said.\nThe court was widely expected to fill the limited number of courtroom seats with carefully selected people to keep away foreign reporters and fellow dissidents.\n"Only the people notified by the court can attend the trial. Others cannot attend," the family member said in a telephone interview.\n"In reality, the trial will not be open...but the court will not admit it is not an open trial," the relative said. "It tells a group of people to attend and calls this an open trial."\nA court official, contacted by telephone, declined to comment.\nIf last year\'s trial of Wei Jingsheng, father of China\'s tiny, struggling democracy movement, was an indication, Wang\'s trial would be kept from public view, a political activist said. Dissidents and foreign reporters were barred from Wei\'s trial.\nCourt officials have confirmed that Wang, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.\nThey have not given further details of the trial though one official said that Wang could appeal to the Higher People\'s Court if convicted.\nRelatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.\nWang\'s mother, Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old museum researcher who has no background in law, has said she would defend her son in court. Chinese law allows an accused to be defended by a family member.\nIt also states that only lawyers can meet detained defendants. Wang\'s mother was allowed to meet the dissident at a detention centre in Beijing on Monday because she was his legal counsel.\nThe dissident was mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, Wang\'s mother told a Hong Kong-based group that monitors human rights in China.\n"Wang Dan said he has not done anything wrong...He is very calm...and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence," the group quoted the mother as saying.\n"She is very worried about his health," the group said.\nIt added that Wang had back, throat and prostate problems.\n"In the condition that Wang Dan is in, it would be difficult for him to hold out under another long prison sentence," it quoted the mother as saying.\nWang, 26, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted Wei Jingsheng implicated Wang.\nThe verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people "convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\n'

"Admittance to the courtroom is often denied to ... journalists and other \'outsiders\' on grounds that the courtroom is \'too small\'," Human Rights Watch said.\nWang\'s court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year\'s trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China\'s tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nWang\'s mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister have been allowed to sit in.\nThe court has refused to give details of Wang\'s trial other than the fact that he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government, but one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People\'s Court if convicted.\nWang\'s mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, though she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.\nHuman Rights Watch was not optimistic about an acquittal. "He has not had adequate time to prepare a defence," it said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.\n"Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence," the group said.\nWang\'s family have found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has in recent months cracked down on its tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been imprisoned.\n'

a(S'The mayor of China\'s capital resigned on Tuesday in a reshuffle that had been expected since the downfall last year of his mentor, disgraced Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, in a corruption scandal.\nThe Beijing People\'s Congress had approved the resignation of city mayor Li Qiyan, the official Xinhua news agency said.\nIt did not explain why Li, 58, was stepping down, saying only that he would become secretary of the Labour Ministry\'s Communist Party committee.\nChinese sources have said Li Qiyan could eventually replace Li Boyong as labour minister. The two men have the same surname but are not related.\nDiplomats and Chinese sources said Li was forced to step down because of his close links to Chen, who resigned as Beijing party boss in April 1995 after his protege, a vice-mayor, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide.\n"Li Qiyan had been closely associated with Chen Xitong...and Li Qiyan\'s departure was inevitable," a Western diplomat said.\n"When revelations about the extent of corruption in the Beijing government became public, sweeping changes of the Beijing leadership were required but could not be done in one go in the interest of preserving stability," the diplomat said.\nChinese sources said the city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen\'s downfall and that authorities had decided they could no longer delay naming a new mayor.\nChen was sacked from the party\'s powerful Politburo in September 1995, the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949.\nHe has since disappeared from public view and has come under investigation for possible wrongdoing.\nIt was not known if Li was under investigation.\nXinhua said the Beijing People\'s Congress, or city council, had approved the appointment of Jia Qinglin, 56, as vice and acting mayor of the nation\'s capital.\nThe Central Committee of the Communist Party named Jia to the post of vice secretary of Beijing\'s party committee.\nJia had resigned as party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian and was replaced by Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi, Xinhua said.\nFujian Vice-Governor He Guoqiang would replace Chen as the provincial governor, it said.\nIn the run-up to the party\'s 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to chief of the Beijing municipal party committee and even land a seat in the Politburo, Chinese sources have said.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nWang Baosen, the vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.

a(S'China\'s exports climbed again in October as slow demand at home encouraged companies to ship abroad and the government expanded credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said Wednesday.\nThe upturn was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet\'s State Planning Commission.\nExports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.9 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said.\n"This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year," Wang said in a telephone interview. Wang said slow domestic demand has forced manufacturers to look to overseas markets.\nAlso, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.\nThe International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.\nExports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency.\nA slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.\nHowever, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.\nImports inched up 3 percent to $11.31 billion in October from October 1995, the Business Daily said.\nThe import data showed that the impact of this year\'s tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, China\'s exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.\nJapan, the United States and Europe remained China\'s largest export markets.\nChina\'s exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.\n'

a(S'China will defrock radical monks in Tibet in a crackdown that could last up to five years in a bid to uproot the influence of the Dalai Lama in his Himalayan homeland, a Chinese propaganda official said on Thursday.\n"Lamas who are comparatively reactionary will be told to return to secular life," the propaganda official said by telephone from Tibet\'s capital, Lhasa.\n"Reorganisation of monasteries... will consist mainly of ideological education... It could continue for three to five years," said the official, who declined to identify himself.\nChina has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, Tibet\'s exiled god-king, in the region, saying religion must conform to socialism instead of the other way round.\nAtheist China views religion as feudal superstition though it tolerates a limited degree of religious freedom.\n"Religious culture... not only hampers social development and economic development, but also stops people becoming more civilised," the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.\nThe newspaper complained last week that monks in Tibet outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings.\n"Monasteries will not be closed... (but) work teams will enter and be stationed at monasteries," the propaganda official said.\nFor several months, China has been stationing "work teams" in Tibetan monasteries. The teams force monks into study sessions on becoming more "patriotic" and into signing pledges supporting Chinese authorities.\n"Those aspects of religion which fail to adapt to social development and impede social progress will be eliminated... to prevent the Dalai Lama from using religion to engage in splittist activities," the official said.\nThere were 1,787 temples in Tibet by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the Tibet Daily has said.\nThe newspaper has complained that healthy young Tibetans were entering the clergy and living off alms instead of working.\nChina has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to try to eradicate the influence of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet\'s holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.\nBeijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.\n"The spiritual realm is the main battlefield of our struggle against the Dalai Lama clique," the Tibet Daily said.\nThe newspaper said last week some temples in Tibet were controlled by supporters of the Dalai Lama and had become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad to engage in separatist activities.\nIt blamed monks and nuns for creating disturbances and sabotaging stability since 1987. Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by the Dalai Lama\'s supporters.\n'

a(S'China\'s breakaway Catholic Church has ordained about 50 graduates of one of the country\'s biggest seminaries into the priesthood this year, clergy at the seminary said on Monday.\nThe new priests, five of whom were ordained on Sunday, were the first group of clergymen installed by the National Catholic Seminary since 1991, they said.\nThe officially authorised seminary in Beijing did not accept any new students for six years from 1986 due to a lack of funds and space, the clergymen said.\n"It\'s a big problem. Funds are too limited," a priest surnamed Meng told Reuters by telephone.\nThe seminary receives 10,000 yuan ($1,200) a year from the government, or one-sixth of its annual budget, another priest said. It raises the rest from donations.\nFather Meng, who graduated in 1991, said there was no shortage of youths, many of them poor, who wanted to become priests.\nHe and other priests denied that government pressure had played a role in the lack of new students between 1986 and 1991.\nCatholics in communist China are allowed to worship openly only if they belong to the state-sponsored Catholic Patriotic Association.\nThe association, which supervises the national seminary, appoints its own bishops and does not recognise the Pope as universal Catholic leader.\nThe official church has the blessings of the Communist Party but it too must walk a fine line between the demands of the party elite and the needs of the faithful.\nThe Washington-based Human Rights Watch/Asia has said Beijing has been stepping up harassment of unauthorised Catholic and Protestant groups in recent years.\nThe group said the crackdown on Christians included stricter controls on contacts with foreigners and was part of a broader drive begun in 1994 against all forms of religion as well as political dissent.\nBishop Zong Huaide of the state-backed church ordained five graduates of the seminary on Sunday. Zong delivered mass at the Church of the Holy Saviour, built in 1703, which was packed with about 3,000 people.\nChina has 31 seminaries and about 1,100 priests, 700 of whom are state-anointed young men.\nThe official Catholic Church in China counts four million members, while the underground church is believed to have several million members.\nVatican relations with Beijing have alternately cooled and warmed over the decades since the late 1950s, when links were severed over the Vatican\'s recognition of Taiwan.\nChina has said it will not normalise relations until the Vatican severs its ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nThe Vatican, on the other hand, has demanded recognition of the Pope\'s primacy before it renews ties with China.\n'

a(S'Australia\'s largest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, forecast a rejuvenation in its profit outlook at its annual meeting on Tuesday but failed to stop shareholders launching into a six-hour tirade aimed at Coles\' directors.\nThe prime target was former executive chairman Solomon Lew, who was re-elected as a director with the help of proxy votes after the floor of the meeting overwhelmingly rejected his re-election. Coles Chairman Nobby Clark, who was jeered when he tried to cut short debate on Lew\'s re-election, said Coles was seeing something of a rejuvenation in its businesses.  \n"We\'re on the edge of something pretty good," Clark told the annual meeting. "We do have an upside and I\'m confident we can do better for you," he said.\n"First quarter performance is running above expectations and we hope that can continue," he said, adding that provided Christmas trading was reasonable, Coles Myer\'s bottom line results should improve in 1996/97.\n'

a(S'Caterpillar Inc., the world\'s largest construction and mining equipment maker, Tuesday reported record third-quarter profits of $310 million, up 45 percent from $213 million a year ago.\nSales jumped to $4.03 billion from $3.73 billion, while earnings per share rose 50 percent to $1.61 from $1.07.\nThe results exceeded expectations on Wall Street and Caterpillar stock jumped $2.50 to $76.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts had forecast profits of $1.34 a share, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.\nFor the first nine months of 1997, sales were $12.06 billion, up slightly from $11.86 billion a year ago, while profit surged to $980 million from $836 million.\n"There really wasn\'t much of a sales increase but there was a tremendous bottom-line increase," Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Douglas Oberhelman said in a telephone interview. Most of the earnings gain was due to improved operations, though some was currency related, he said.\nProfit margins rose to 25 percent in the quarter from 19 percent a year ago, primarily due to higher prices, stronger volume and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, Caterpillar said. Price gains were seen equally inside and outside the United States, Oberhelman said.\nContinuing improvements in manufacturing and essentially flat material costs also helped boost profits but were partly offset by an unfavourable product sales mix, the heavy equipment maker said.\nThe sales mix in the quarter shifted more toward lower margin smaller machines, Oberhelman said, but he added that this mix shifts month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter.\n"The thing that\'s encouraging is the gross margins remain strong," said Lisa Shalett, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. "It looks like the productivity gains they talked about in the second quarter are continuing"\nHigher machine sales in the United States accounted for most of a 5 percent increase in sales volume in the quarter, Caterpillar said.\nBut deliveries to U.S. dealer rental fleets fell from a year ago as rental inventories remained high, the company said.\nMachine sales in Europe fell due to declines in Germany and France, where the contruction sector remains weak, the company said. Sales in China, Japan, Australia and Latin America were up, while sales in Canada were unchanged and sales fell in the former Soviet Union.\nThe company also said it expected 1997 sales to be up slightly from an expected record in 1996, while it expects 1996 profits to exceed the $1.14 billion reported in 1995. The current record for sales is $16.07 billion, set in 1995.\n"Our preliminary outlook for 1997 is to slightly surpass the record levels achieved in 1996," Chairman Donald Fites said in a statement.\n"We continue to see opportunities for solid growth in the vast majority of the global markets we serve, particularly in the fast-growing developing nations where infrastructure needs are greatest," Fites said.\nHigher industrial demand in developing regions, Canada and Australia are expected to offset slightly lower demand in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Peoria, Ill.-based company said.\n"The outlook statement surprised me on two levels," Shalett said. "It talked about slightly higher sales but not higher profit. I thought that was deliberate."\nShe also said that while sales gains outside the United States, Europe and Japan are expected to offset lower demand in those areas, "it\'s not clear to us that it makes up for (those areas) on the profit side."\n'

a(S'H&amp;R Block Inc. Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent.\nH&amp;R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million.\nKansas City-based H&amp;R Block, the nation\'s largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world\'s second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States.\nH&amp;R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit.\nBut plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses.\nJust nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe\'s value was being held back by H&amp;R Block\'s staid tax business.\nNow they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&amp;R Block\'s performance.\n"The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe\'s valuation is clearly holding back H&amp;R Block\'s valuation," said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.\n"How quickly things change," said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. "What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected."\nAnalysts said H&amp;R Block was waiting for CompuServe\'s new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed.\nH&amp;R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.\n"Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company\'s profitability," said Frank Salizzoni, H&amp;R Block\'s president and chief executive officer and CompuServe\'s chairman.\n"In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe."\nBoth Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&amp;R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company\'s core tax business.\nThe company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago.\n"This year\'s deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company\'s investments to expand its office network and roll out new products," Salizzoni said.\n"They\'re making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue," Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year.\nH&amp;R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. CompuServe lost 93.75 cents to $10.6875 on Nasdaq.\n'

a(S'Freight hauler Yellow Corp. said Wednesday it could cut 1 percent to 2 percent of its workforce as part of a restructuring of its largest operating unit, Yellow Freight System.\nOverland Park, Kan.-based Yellow Corp. said it has offered early retirement to 153 employees who are 55 and older and that it will announce layoffs in the first quarter.\nThe company also said it will take an unspecified charge to fourth quarter earnings to cover expenses resulting from early retirement, severance and other costs related to a reorganization of Yellow Freight along geographic lines.\nEach geographic unit will have a group vice president who reports to Yellow Freight President Bill Zollars, while five officers at the central office will also report to Zollars, the company said.\n"We are decentralizing responsibility for the business processes that touch the customer in an effort to be more responsive to their LTL needs," Zollars said of the less-than-truckload freight hauling business.\n"All members of the leadership and management teams will be focused and incentive-based on four priorities," said Zollars. "Those areas are customer satisfaction, improved profitability, revenue growth and operating safely."\nEmployees will have until Jan. 15 to make their decisions on whether to take early retirement, Yellow said.\nThe number of layoffs will be determined, in part, based on the early retirement decisions, as well as the needs of the company as it reorganizes, a spokesman said. He estimated about 1 percent to 2 percent of Yellow\'s 24,700 employees could be affected.\nAnalysts said the moves announced Wednesday were part of a strategy to improve performance at Yellow and help it regain market share.\n"I think they need to focus on some labour productivity," said Corina Bergschneider, analyst at George K. Baum &amp; Co. "Obviously, that needs to be done in line with their union contract and what can be allowed."\nYellow shares fell 12.5 cents to $14.50 on the Nasdaq system.\n'

a(S'First Chicago NBD Corp, while still open to acquisitions to expand its banking network, expects more retail branches to be cut over time as customers bank electronically or at supermarkets.\n"As customers use more and more of those (channels), we\'ve got to take away more of the brick and mortar" branches, Verne Istock, chief executive, said in an interview Thursday.\nBut don\'t expect First Chicago to make drastic cuts like the nearly 280 branches that Ohio-based KeyCorp said last month it would close or sell.  \n"I don\'t think that\'s the approach we want," Istock said. "I think that\'s pretty dramatic. I think you\'re better off to do it on an orderly basis from a customer satisfaction standpoint as well as an employee basis."\nFirst Chicago has closed about 25 branches since the merger with Detroit-based NBD Bancorp a year ago that created what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States, with $106.7 billion in assets.\nBut at the same time, First Chicago could be looking to expand its retail customer base through acquisitions of other banks in the greater Midwest.  \n"I have publicly said on more occasions than once that this organization does have an interest in expanding through acquisitions where it makes sense for shareholders," Istock said.\nThis means any acquisition First Chicago does could only dilute earnings for a short time, if at all, he added.\nBut Istock also said First Chicago has not had talks with Milwaukee based Firstar Corp, which has been mentioned as a possible First Chicago target for at least a year.\n"We\'ve had no discussions," he said of Firstar. He would not comment on other possible acquisition targets.  \nIstock also reiterated that an acquisition could be made outside of traditional banking as regulatory lines between banking other financial businesses are erased.\nInsurance, investment banking and securities banking are all areas that could be targets of traditional banks, he said.\n"We\'re willing to consider any alternative that we think makes sense for our shareholders first of all and also for enhancing our customer relationships," Istock said.\nAnalysts see First Chicago as having excess capital on its books, which weighs on a bank\'s performance. EVEREN Securities analyst Thomas Maier said the bank could have more than $2 billion in excess capital, while others estimate a lower amount.\nAn aggressive 40-million-share stock repurchase plan has helped allay analysts\' and investors\' concerns about the excess capital. But making a purchase could also put capital to work.\n"It\'s a way of in fact buying your stock back without having to go out in the market to do it," Maier said.\nFirst Chicago shares were up 5/8 at 55-1/2 Friday.\n((--Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787))\n'

a(S'Firstar Corp\'s announcement on Thursday that it expected to fall short of analysts\' fourth-quarter earnings estimates for what it believes are temporary factors includes one element -- a continued modest decline in commercial loans outstanding -- that could be a more lasting concern, analysts said.\nThe Milwaukee-based bank holding company, which has $19.9 billion in assets, said it expects fourth quarter earnings of about $0.95 a share excluding any one-time gains, $0.08 short of the consensus and unchanged from a year ago.  \nFirstar is in the midst of a program to trim costs and enhance revenues and said factors including the implementation of that program and assimilation of recent acquisitions would hurt earnings. But the bank also said continued declines in its commercial loans outstanding would also hinder earnings, and was a temporary factor.\n"I think while that sounds plausible, it also remains to be proven," said Ben Crabtree, banking analyst at Dain Bosworth. Crabtree had forecast earnings of $1.08 a share for the quarter.  \nWhile expenses from the restructuring and acquisitions should eventually be eliminated, analysts were not as sure that the loss of loans would be reversed.\n"The question going forward, and that\'s an unanswerable question, is the long-term impact on the revenue side," said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities.\nFirstar investor relations spokesman Joe Messinger said the decline in loans outstanding is due mostly to the focus on the restructuring during the first two quarters of the year.  \nFirstar also said credit card charge-offs will remain higher than the company\'s historic levels in the quarter, though they will be in line with the industry overall.\n"It\'s something they\'ve indicated in the past," Maier said, adding that higher charge-offs were already built into his previous $1.05 a share estimate on fourth quarter earnings and outperform rating on the stock.\nIn the 10-Q filing with the SEC for the third quarter, Firstar said it expected credit card charge-offs to rise to 4.5-5.0 percent in the fourth and first quarters, before declining to 4-4.5 percent. Charge-offs were 4.06 percent in the third quarter.\nIf Firstar meets its $0.95 a share estimate for the quarter, 1996 earnings would be $3.34 a share, compared to $3.00 a share a year ago.\nFirstar shares fell one to 51 Thursday amid a downturn in banking stocks.\n((--Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787))\n'

a(S'Mercantile Bancorp Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. for about $1 billion in cash and stock, a move that would create the largest bank in Missouri.\nThe companies said the acquisition will create the largest locally managed and independently owned financial services organisation based in the southern Midwest. It will make Mercantile the largest banking company in Missouri, with more than 23 percent of the state\'s deposits, Mercantile said.\nMercantile will become the largest bank in St. Louis, where it is headquartered, and in Springfield, Mo., and will strengthen its presence in other major Missouri markets such as Kansas City.\nRoosevelt, a savings and loan with $9 billion in assets that is also based in St. Louis, has 81 offices and branches in Missouri, Kansas and Illinois.\nThe acquisition follows Mercantile\'s agreement to buy Mark Twain Bancshares Inc., another St. Louis-based bank, for $855 million in stock. That deal was announced on Oct. 28.\n"Our combination with Roosevelt will materially enhance our mix of strong retail, middle market lending and other speciality businesses," Mercantile Chairman Thomas Jacobsen said in a statement.\nMercantile plans to take a pretax charge of $25 million to $30 million for merger-related costs when the deal closes next year but also expects it to add to earnings in 1997 and 1998, officials said.\nThe deal would save about $20 million a year in branch costs annually, Jacobsen said but would not elaborate on how many branches would be closed.\n"There will be some certainly, but probably fewer than you might think," Jacobsen said at a news conference.\nAnalysts said they were told separately that about 50 overlapping branches were expected to be closed by 1998.\nDue to attrition and since the two companies will not be completely merged, layoffs were expected to be minimal, officials said.\n"We\'re not aware of anyone at this time that won\'t be able to find a role with the ongoing company," said Stanley Bradshaw, chief executive at Roosevelt.\nMercantile, which said both the Roosevelt and Mark Twain acquisitions were expected to close in the second quarter of 1997, would not rule out future acquisitions.\n"We have continuing interest in Illinois, Iowa and Arkansas," said John Beirise, group vice president for emerging markets at Mercantile. "Oklahoma has interest to us and would also be a logical extension."\nThe Mercantile that emerges after the pending takeovers are completed will have $30 billion in assets and could itself become an attractive takeover target, analysts said.\nMercantile, which will have a stock market worth of more than $4 billion, could be even more attractive once the acquisitions have been assimilated.\n"I\'d say Merc was already attractive anyway," said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, which advised Roosevelt on the deal. "This makes them no less atttractive."\nSaid Joseph Roberto, banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, "I think it makes Mercantile more attractive. It gives them the No. 1 market share across the state."\nMercantile said it will exchange up to 13 million shares of its stock at a ratio of 0.4211 Mercantile share for each Roosevelt share, and pay $22 cash for each remaining share.\nBased on the $50.75 closing price Friday of Mercantile\'s shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the exchange ratio would value Roosevelt shares at about $21.37 each. Roosevelt\'s stock closed Friday at $18.125 on Nasdaq.\nRoosevelt shares added $2.375 to $20.50 on Nasdaq while Mercantile stock fell $1 to $49.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nMercantile also said it planned to repurchase up to 7 million of its own shares in connection with the acquisition.\n'

a(S'The U.S. economy should provide a repeat in 1997 of the steady growth seen in 1996, which should also lead to car and truck sales near 1996 levels, according to economists who work for the Big Three automakers.\nEconomists for Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp both forecast vehicle sales between 15 million and 15.5 million in 1997, while Chrysler Corp\'s economist predicted sales of 15.2 million. Sales were about 15.4 million in 1996. The forecasts were made in a presentation to the Society of Automotive Analysts.  \n"We are likely to see more of the same," Chrysler\'s W. Van Bussmann said, echoing the view of the other two analysts.\n"We see no significant changes in either direction on fiscal or monetary policy," said G. Mustafa Mohatarem of General Motors.\nFord\'s Martin Zimmerman was even more optimistic. "I frankly don\'t see why this growth can\'t continue into 1998," he said.  \nBut that does not mean the auto industry has no concerns. The one short-term worry all three economists voiced was the weakening of the yen, which fell to about 117 to the dollar Monday from about 106 a year ago. A weaker yen makes Japanese imports, including automobiles, less expensive in the United States.\nThat, in turn, makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market, giving Japanese automakers more flexibility in pricing, analysts said.  \nBut the analysts all expected political or market pressures to cause the yen to stabilize and then strengthen somewhat against the dollar this year.\n"We should see the yen start to strengthen," Zimmerman said.\nBussmann forecast the yen at 106 to the dollar by the end of 1997.\nIn western Europe, analysts see continued economic pressure associated with the move to European union in 1999 continuing to weigh on the economy there and keep vehicle sales about flat.  \nBut Mohatarem argued that there is a possibility for a positive surprise in central Europe, saying Russia could achieve three percent economic growth by 1998.\nMexico was also seen as an area for growth, with that economy recoverying quicker than expected from the recent peso crisis, analysts said.\nMeanwhile, Bussmann argued that capacity usage for truck production will remain at about 80 percent through the year 2000 and that truck demand as a percentage of total vehicle market share will continue to rise.\n"We see the light truck demand reaching 50 percent (of total vehicle demand) by just past the turn of the century," he said.\nBut other analysts were not as optimistic about demand for light trucks, which generally have higher profit margins than cars.\n"I don\'t think it will reach 50 percent of demand," said Thomas Webb, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association.\nDuring his presentation, Webb also said his forecast for 1997 auto sales was on the low end of a range he defined between 14.7 million and 15.1 million autos.\n\t ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787))\n'

a(S'Mercury Finance Co. said Wednesday it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years and that its chief accountant had apparently disappeared.\nThe Northbrook, Ill.-based finance company said the irregularities appear to have come from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer.\nThe company said a special committee of the board has been formed to investigate with legal and accounting experts.\nThe accountant, James Doyle, was last seen at the company on Jan. 23, the day it reported fourth quarter results, Mercury Finance spokesman Joseph Kopec said.\n"He called Friday and said he would not be in for personal reasons," Kopec said. "They haven\'t seen him since."\nDoyle\'s whereabouts were unknown.\nThe problems may jeopardise Mercury\'s planned acquisition of Fidelity Acceptance Corp., a consumer finance company, from BankBoston Corp. in a $393 million deal announced on Jan. 10.\nWednesday\'s announcement caught the financial community by surprise, with analysts unwilling to comment after Mercury\'s statement, saying they were still trying to gather information.\nAs a result of the adjustments, shareholders\' equity as of Dec. 31, 1996, would be reduced from $353 million to $263 million, the company said.\nAs a result of the overstatement of earnings, Mercury said it is in violation of some of its debt agreements and was negotiating with lenders.\nIt said its financial condition remained strong and would support continuing operations and its expansion plans.\nBankBoston said it would await the results of the accounting investigation before proceeding with the sale of Fidelity Acceptance. Mercury said it was optimistic about completing the deal.\nMercury said 1996 net income would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million, 1995 profits would be cut to $76.9 million from $98.9 million and 1994 earnings would be $83 million instead of the $86.5 million originally reported.\nIn addition, 1993 profits would be trimmed to $64.2 million from $64.9 million.\nMercury stock was halted all day on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed Tuesday at $14.875.\nMoody\'s Investors Service cut its rating on Mercury\'s short-term borrowings and Standard &amp; Poor\'s said it may lower its rating.\nMercury Finance suffered another blow last year, when Daniel Terra, chairman of the company since it went public in 1989, died in June.\n'

a(S'Mercury Finance Co. got hit by a lawsuit charging it violated securities laws after the auto-loan company said phony bookkeeping entries had inflated its earnings and that it fired its chief accountant.\nThe stock, which remained halted on the New York Stock Exchange, has not traded since it closed at $14.875 on Tuesday.\nThe exchange would not indicate where the stock might open but traders said it was changing hands at $4.25 overseas, which would mean a loss of more than $1.8 billion in market worth for the company, based in suburban Lake Forest, Ill.\nOne of the officers named in the lawsuit was James Doyle, the former controller who Mercury said has not been seen since last Thursday. In its statement on Wednesday, Mercury said it fired Doyle.\nFiled in federal court in Chicago on Wednesday, the lawsuit alleges the company and some senior officers misrepresented or omitted crucial information about Mercury\'s earnings for the last three years, lawyers who filed the suit said in a statement.\nThe lawsuit also said Doyle had sold tens of thousands and Chairman John Brincat hundreds of thousands of shares of Mercury stock at inflated prices, netting millions of dollars in illegal profits.\nBrincat was not available for comment. A company spokesman declined to comment. Attempts to locate Doyle were not successful.\nThe finance company said on Wednesday its 1996 earnings would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million and that earnings for the three prior years would also adjusted downward, though not as sharply.\nThe problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer, Doyle, the company said.\nIt also said it was in violation of certain provisions if its loan agreements and that a special committee of directors has been formed to investigate the problems.\nAnalysts were hesitant to talk about Mercury, saying they did not have much information.\nBut they did say the company\'s planned acquisition of Fidelity Acceptance from BankBoston Corp. was unlikely to be completed. The deal, announced on Jan. 10, called for Mercury to issue about $458 million in stock to BankBoston. BankBoston said on Wednesday it was awaiting an audit of Mercury.\n"I think the odds are very high that the deal will not go through," one analyst said, who asked not to be identified.\nAnalysts also said Mercury has not been as forthcoming as other consumer finance companies when providing detailed financial information.\nMercury helped pioneer the business of lending to consumers whose credit was less than perfect. It started making loans to people in the military and has grown into one of the country\'s largest lenders in the used-car market.\n"They haven\'t been quite as open as any others in the industry have been," one analyst said.\nTwo brokerage firms cut ratings on Mercury Thursday.\nGruntal &amp; Co. said it suspended its rating, adding, "We recommend that holders exit positions as soon as possible."\nPiper Jaffray cut its rating to market performer from buy and in a research report said, "Our guess is most of the over recognised income came from (Mercury\'s) insurance subsidiary."\n'

a(S'Canada\'s six biggest banks are poised for a further round of buoyant profits when they begin reporting third-quarter earnings Tuesday, setting the stage for a third consecutive record year, analysts said.\nAn improved interest rate picture, higher investment banking and dealing revenues and better loan quality are expected to drive profits in the third quarter ended July 31.\nOn average, earnings for the so-called Big Six are expected to be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the third quarter of last year, analysts said.\n"I would expect more sectors of the banks to be more profitable than they were in the corresponding quarter of last year," said Roy Palmer, an analyst with TD Securities.\nBank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada\'s third- and fourth-largest banks, respectively, kick off the earnings parade on Tuesday.\nCanada\'s fifth-biggest bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and the smallest, National Bank of Canada, report on Thursday.\nThe country\'s top two banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, are scheduled to deliver their results Sept. 5.\nDespite a recent downturn in financial markets, analysts said securities earnings should be stronger than last year. Canada\'s brokerage industry is dominated by subsidiaries of the countries major banks.\nThe banks are also expected to benefit from lower loan losses as the industry continues to rebound from disastrous loans in commercial real estate, which collapsed in the late 1980\'s.\nDespite the correction in stocks earlier this summer, bank stocks have remained strong performers. Lower Canadian interest rates have helped push bank stock prices to all-time highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n"I think that if the combination of strong profitability couples up with lower interest rates, then it probably will set the backdrop for higher share prices," said Susan Cohen, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp.\nAnalysts said they do not expect any of the banks to raise their dividends during the reporting period.\nBut the string of record bank profits are expected to yield dividend hikes at the end of the fiscal year.\nThe big banks are on track for a third straight year of record annual profits. The group rang up a combined profit of C$5.17 billion in fiscal 1995 ended Oct. 31, up from C$4.25 billion a year earlier.\nAs for 1997, Palmer said he expects a modest increase in profits.\n"Investment banking is a cyclical business. It may tail off a bit, but there is no sign of a recession yet, so I would think we could get modestly higher earnings next year," he said.\nBank of Montreal is expected to report a third-quarter profit of 97 cents Canadian (70.8 cents) per share, up from 93 cents Canadian (67.9 cents) per share a year ago, according to figures supplied by the International Brokers Estimates Service.\nScotiabank\'s earnings are seen climbing to C$1 (73 cents) per share in the third quarter, up from 86 cents Canadian (62.8 cents) a share.\nToronto-Dominion Bank is expected to post a 72 cents Canadian (52.5 cents) per share profit, up slightly from 71 cents Canadian (51.8 cents) per share in the third quarter of 1995.\nNational Bank\'s third quarter earnings are forecast to rise to 41 cents Canadian (29.9 cents) per share from 33 cents (24.1 cents) Canadian a share a year earlier.\nCIBC\'s third quarter results are pegged at C$1.42 ($1.04) a share compared to last year\'s C$1.13 ($82 cents) per share.\nRoyal Bank of Canada is seen improving to 96 cents Canadian (70 cents) a share in the third quarter, up from 88 cents Canadian (64.2 cents) per share a year earlier.\n'

a(S'The Canadian Football League is set to hold what many fear may be its last Grey Cup championship on Sunday after a chaotic, money-losing season.\nThe championship between the Toronto Argonauts -- led by former Boston College star quarterback Doug Flutie -- and the Edmonton Eskimos, is the 84th league title game.\nBut some wonder if there will be a Grey Cup next year.\nDespite returning to its Canadian roots this year after a failed U.S. expansion, the CFL is dripping red ink. All but one of its nine clubs will lose money, due to small crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season.\nThe 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded earlier this month at the end of the regular season.\nSo precarious are the league\'s finances that the cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players\' wives to the Grey Cup game in Hamilton, Ontario, 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Toronto.\n"The LAST Grey Cup?" asked the Toronto Star, Canada\'s biggest newspaper, in a front page story on Friday.\nSome say the CFL needs the bigger and richer National Football League to survive.\nCFL Commissioner Larry Smith said he is interested in "building a relationship" with the NFL, but that the CFL will not become a Triple A minor league.\n"I have no interest in a farm system. If we could have some developmental relationships like we\'ve done in the past with guys like Warren Moon and Joe Theismann, then that would be great," Smith said in a telephone interview.\nMoon and Theismann were star CFL quarterbacks in the 1970s and 1980s before jumping to the NFL.\n"What we have been doing is exploring some ideas on ways we could possibly work together. But we have not reached an agreement on anything at this point," said Greg Aiello, director of communications for the NFL.\nCFL purists fear closer ties with the NFL would threaten the distinctiveness of Canadian-style football.\nCanada\'s game closely resembles the U.S. brand, but there are a few key differences. The playing field is longer and wider. Canadian teams get only three downs instead of four to gain 10 yards and keep possession of the ball.\nThere are 12 players a side compared to 11, and single points are awarded for missed field goals not run out of the end zone.\nFootball writer and former CFL player Frank Cosentino said the NFL could help pay the salaries of developing players, but that closer ties could alienate the CFL\'s remaining followers.\nBut fans already appear to have turned off the CFL.\nAverage attendance slipped to 22,095 this year from 24,400 in 1995, despite a slick new "Radically Canadian" marketing campaign trumpeting the league\'s Canadian heritage.\nIn major markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, the league is considered second-rate.\nA 1995 pre-season NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills in Toronto drew about 60,000 fans. This year, the Argonauts, despite the league\'s best record of 15-3, averaged just 20,400 fans.\nUnless there is a late surge in ticket sales, the Grey Cup game will fall short of a sell-out. "The way it looks now we may have about 36,000. We have capacity for about 40,000," organiser Matthew Moreland said on Friday.\nIt is a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s when the CFL attracted huge crowds and players such as Ron Lancaster, Joe Kapp, Angelo Mosca and Sam Etcheverry were household names.\nPlayers now rarely stay long enough to become known by fans. Poor marketing has also left the CFL far behind other sports in the race for the public\'s entertainment dollars.\nIn a bid to save the league, Smith has proposed a restructuring plan to cut costs. All clubs have until January to secure enough season-ticket sales to operate next year.\nSmith is confident there will be eight teams next year, but he said the CFL was prepared to operate with fewer.\nThere will likely be no football in Ottawa, next year after the league revoked the franchise in Canada\'s capital from Chicago businessman Horn Chen.\nThe future is also cloudy for the Montreal Alouettes -- who won the Grey Cup last year as the Baltimore Stallions, but lured few fans this season -- and the British Columbia Lions, who are in receivership.\n'

a(S"A strike at General Motors Corp.'s Indianapolis metal stamping plant is expected to force two more GM truck assembly plants to shut down Thursday night, ratcheting up the United Auto Workers union's bargaining pressure on the automaker.\nA GM source said the two truck plants will run out of parts from Indianapolis late Thursday night during their second production shifts, joining a plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., that shut down Wednesday night.\nThe Fort Wayne plant laid off about 2,250 of its 2,600 workers as it halted production of GM's popular full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks.\nThe official declined to identify the plants, but said they will be among several still-operating truck facilities that receive hoods, fenders and other large body panels from Indianapolis, including Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio; and Silao, Mexico.\nThe strike by 2,750 workers at Indianapolis and a second walkout by 4,800 workers in Janesville, Wis., have formed a two-pronged effort to squeeze GM's highly profitable light truck operations.\nMeanwhile, GM and the UAW continued a more than 24-hour bargaining session Thursday in an effort to hammer out a new national labour contract covering 215,000 GM hourly workers.\nThe marathon session, which started at about 10 a.m. EST, was the longest so far between the union and the world's largest automaker, said GM spokesman Charles Licari.\nHe declined to comment on any progress being made.\nTypically, negotiators in labour contract talks for Detroit's Big Three automakers meet for long periods to work out final details just before reaching a tentative agreement.\nBut analysts say the dollar cost of lost truck production due to the Indianapolis and Janesville strikes could mount quickly, shutting off GM's biggest source of profits.\nThe shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, adding to pressure on GM for national and local contract settlements, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.\nThe southern Wisconsin factory is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes an average of $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks.\nAs its truck operations grind toward a halt, the company's U.S. car assembly plants affected by a three-week strike in Canada earlier this month are starting to come back to life.\nGM said Thursday that 4,200 idled workers returned to their jobs at car plants in Flint, Mich., and Fairfax, Kansas, cutting the total number of U.S. workers laid off due to the Canadian Auto Workers walkout to 19,958.\nThe future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive has been a major sticking point in the negotiations. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.\nFord Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.\nGM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.\nGM's stock was off 50 cents at $52.875 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n"

a(S'Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking their toll on the rest of General Motors Corp.\'s truck production Wednesday, clouding the automaker\'s national contract talks with the United Auto Workers.\nGM said the day-old walkout at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant would force it to halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks at its Fort Wayne, Ind., assembly plant Wednesday night.\nThe Indianapolis walkout on Tuesday has halted shipments of major steel body panels to nine of GM\'s 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening to shut them down within days.\nAnalysts said Wednesday the cost of the strikes by 2,750 workers in Indianapolis and 4,800 workers at its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant could mount quickly, eating into profits from GM\'s lucrative light truck operations.\nThe shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.\nThe southern Wisconsin factory, which employs 4,800 workers, is the sole source for GM\'s popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes about $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks.\nIn addition to Janesville and Fort Wayne, the Indianapolis plant supplies facilities in Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio, and Silao, Mexico.\n"It really starts to add up quickly when you add in all of the other big C/K pickups they can lose," said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.\nThe UAW strikes came as GM is still staggering from a three-week strike in Canada that curtailed production at a number of U.S. plants and may cost up to $450 million.\nOn Wednesday, GM said it still had 23,158 U.S. workers idled due to shortages of Canadian-made parts, but added that 3,200 workers at its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to return to work on Thursday.\nNo other UAW strikes had started on Wednesday, but UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union was not ruling out other walkouts. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after GM\'s national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers expired.\n"Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own," McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout.\nSome UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck, because they would force shutdowns at other facilities.\nNational contract talks continued Wednesday at GM\'s Detroit headquarters, but officials declined to say whether progress was being made.\n"Talks are taking place at all levels," said GM spokesman Charles Licari.\nAlthough UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.\nThat may take place before Saturday, when about 250 UAW leaders from GM plants across the nation are scheduled to meet in Detroit to discuss the status of the talks.\nThe future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations Wednesday. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.\nFord Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit\'s Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.\nGM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.\n"We know the sale is going to happen. We\'re concerned about what\'s going to happen to us," said Whitey Hale, president of UAW Local 326 in Flint.\n'

a(S'In a sign that agreement on a labour contract between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers may still have significant hurdles, the union said Friday it cancelled a meeting of its National GM Council that was scheduled here for Saturday.\nThe council, made up of about 250 plant-level leaders at GM locals across the country, was expected to vote on a tentative agreement covering GM\'s 215,000 UAW workers.\nUAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to give a reason for the cancellation, but said the council will meet instead on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Chicago, if the union reaches an agreement with GM in the next few days.\nOne official close to the talks said the meeting was cancelled because the union did not reach a deal in time to print up summaries for the GM council members to review on Saturday. He did not rule out reaching an agreement on Friday.\n"They\'re working on trying to resolve the final issues," GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said.\nStill, the cancellation was viewed as a negative sign for the GM contract talks, which had resumed Friday after bargainers rested up before making another push for a tentative agreement. They bargained for 32 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, fuelling optimism that a settlement was near.\nThe two sides have been haggling over the total number of hourly workers that GM will guarantee to maintain over the next three years.\nFord Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces, but GM wants to exclude several parts plants from the guarantees.\nGM, the least efficient of Detroit\'s Big Three, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs and shift more parts work to outside suppliers.\nGM is expected to match the Ford and Chrysler wage package, which calls for a $2,000 bonus in the first year, and 3 percent base wage increases in the second and third years.\nMeanwhile, the toll of lost profits and idled workers from local strikes in Janesville, Wis., and Indianapolis continued to mount for GM.\nIncluding 2,750 strikers at the Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,809 at the Janesville truck assembly plant, GM said the walkouts had idled a total of 13,309 workers by midday Friday.\nAnother 2,400 were scheduled to be sent home from GM\'s Shreveport, La., plant later Friday afternoon, and up to 2,500 workers in Linden, N.J., were told not to report to work on Monday.\nThe two factories are among nine GM truck plants in North America that receive fenders, hoods, roofs and other major body panels from Indianapolis.\nMichael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber, said the Janesville, Fort Wayne and Moraine shutdowns alone will cost GM $10 million a day in after-tax lost profits.\n"We\'re looking at $10 million a day right now, and that could easily expand to $20 million by Monday," Ward said.\nAbout 3,500 workers were idled at GM\'s Moraine, Ohio, compact sport utility vehicle plant Thursday night, while 2,250 workers were laid off at GM\'s Fort Wayne, Ind., full-size pickup truck assembly plant on Wednesday night.\nIn addition, 900 workers who build V-8 engines for trucks assembled in Janesville and Fort Wayne were idled on Friday.\nA full-size truck plant in Flint, Mich., had been expected to be idled Thursday night, but union officials said GM diverted enough parts to keep it running several more days.\n"GM\'ll start funnelling the parts around to the plants that they want to keep going," said Doug Bellamy, vice president of UAW Local 598 in Flint.\nLayoffs from the UAW strikes are increasing as GM\'s U.S. car operations are still staggering from the effects of the three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23.\nGM said it still had 18,958 workers idled by continuing shortages of Canadian-made parts at six car assembly plants, six engine and transmission plants and four metal stamping facilities.\n'

a(S'General Motors Corp cut a deal to end a costly strike at an Indianapolis metal stamping plant on Saturday, about 14 hours after it announced a tentative national contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union.\nThe five-day Indianapolis strike had threatened to paralyze most of GM\'s North American light truck production by early next week. Along with a second, still-unresolved walkout at GM\'s Janesville, Wisconsin, truck plant, the dispute was responsible for the idling of more than 19,000 workers.\nBut the 2,750 Indianapolis strikers could be back on the job stamping out fenders, doors, hoods and other truck body parts by Sunday night following a ratification vote scheduled for Sunday morning, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM\'s Metal Fabricating Division.\nHowever, GM\'s full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, may still shut down on Monday due to shortages of Indianapolis-made parts, joining four other idled truck plants and an crippled engine plant.\nRonald Gettelfinger, UAW regional director in Indianapolis, said the new local labor agreement, reached at about 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT) on Saturday, was not influenced by the national GM-UAW labor accord, which covers 215,000 U.S. hourly workers.\nThe national contract defines wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues, while local pacts cover plant specific issues like work rules and staffing levels.\n"We\'ve got great negotiators at the top," Gettelfinger said. "This was local issues."\nHe declined to discuss the grievances that sparked the strike. They were believed to include demands for more jobs to cope with an increasing workload and protections for skilled trades workers.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich, who announced the national pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of more local strikes to keep GM from dragging its feet in negotiations with its 123 locals.\n"We can\'t tell you what\'s going to happen in the other locals," Yokich said. "I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up."\nPresident Bill Clinton applauded UAW-GM agreement on Saturday. "I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work," he said.\nAbout 4,800 workers in Janesville remain on strike, although UAW Local 95 officials said local talks intensified on Saturday. The plant, which builds GM\'s popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicles, is one of the automaker\'s most profitable factories.\nAnalysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker up to $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of an estimated $350 million loss from a Canadian walkout that ended on Oct. 23.\nThe UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union\'s national GM bargaining council.\nDetails of the pact were not released on Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp\nBoth of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.\nOne union official said the pact maintains the 95 percent job guarantee but allows GM some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses and to allow employment at some factories to fall below that threshold.\nIn a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM\'s Detroit headquarters building.\n"I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation," said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. "Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want."\n'

a(S'British building group AMEC Plc said on Friday it was exploring a possible investment in France\'s Spie Batignolle\'s electrical and construction businesses with the aim of widening its international exposure.\nAMEC said it had been in talks with Spie management about taking an unquantified minority stake which could be raised to a majority stake from the current parent group Schneider SA.\nIf clinched, the deal would create a major European player with around five billion pounds ($7.9 billion) in sales, with 40 percent exposure in Britain, 30 percent in France and the rest worldwide.\nPeter Mason, AMEC\'s chief executive, told Reuters: "One important concept is that there is little overlap between the two groups."\nHe admitted that AMEC\'s possible greater exposure to France came as the market was suffering from very tough conditions but he said that AMEC was "buying at the bottom, not at the top" and foresaw a turnaround.\nThe new deal could act as a springboard for AMEC into new markets including oil and gas and pharmaceuticals and new regions including Indonesia, Latin America and South Africa, Mason said.\nAt present 70 percent of its sales are in Britain.\nMason told Reuters that the two parties were at the due diligence stage and expected more details by November, with completion in December.\nThe initial stake will be funded from AMEC\'s existing cash reserves and will give it access to Spie\'s international network of regional bases offering partnership opportunities on a cost-efficient basis.\nThe decision to raise the stake to a majority holding would be taken in "a number of years\' time and I\'m not talking one or two years".\nAMEC and Spie management envisage a possible flotation of the French operation.\n"There will be negotiations between the management and us on how much we will retain and what to float. It will also depend on the state of the (stock) market at the time," the AMEC chief said.\n"I have been most impressed with Spie\'s management team and the progress they have made in revitalising Spie," he added.\nSpie has 28,000 employees and operates in 290 locations. In its 1995 results after restructuring it reported turnover of 17 billion francs ($3.26 billion) and an operating profit of 34 million francs. ($1=.6298 Pound) ($1=5.211 French Franc)\n'

a(S'British building materials company Wolseley Plc reported a one percent slip in year pretax profits on Tuesday, but despite topping analysts\' forecasts in a tough market shares slid on the poor outlook for mainland Europe.\nPretax profits for the year ended July 31 fell to 242.9 million pounds ($387 million) from 245.4 million. But sales rose to 4.31 billion from 3.78 billion pounds and the dividend was raised to 10.35 pence from 9.80 last year.\nThe fallback in profits had been flagged in a profit warning earlier this year.\nBut Wolseley survived the difficult conditions better than others partly thanks to its lower European exposure. The group has 50 percent of its sales in the U.S.\nChairman Richard Ireland reported organic sales growth across all three divisions blaming the lower profits on "poor economic conditions in mainland Europe and volatile lumber prices in the U.S."\n"The results for 1996 should be set against the background of economic difficulties in France and Austria and a flat home (UK) market," he said.\nBut in an interview with Reuters chief financial controller Stephen Webster said "I do not see an upturn in the next 12 months in France, Austria or Germany."\nHe denied it would seriously dampen profits this coming year, explaining that conditions remain stable.\nThe UK market showed a glimmer of recovery, with spending on repair and maintenance of homes moving ahead.\nBut Webster said the housebuilding sector had seen companies using up existing stock so there has been little feed-through to companies like Wolseley. He predicted it would be spring before the industry felt the benefits.\nThe finance chief also expressed concern about the threat of an interest rate hike in the U.S. "A half a percent would not be a big deal but one percent could damage confidence."\nThe caution in all its markets was enough to push shares lower. By 1045 GMT they were down 13 pence at 494.\nThe new chief executive John Young did not signal any departure from the group\'s existing strategy.\nBut Webster signalled the possibility of some change "We are keen to keep the good things. If anything it may mean a change of style. "But there are no sacred cows in Wolseley. We will take difficult decisions if needed."\nYoung said in the interim statement he wanted to look to expansion into new regions and products. With gearing at a low 7.7 percent, there is scope to raise it to around 30 percent if a big acquisition comes along, said Webster.\n$1=.6270 Pound)\n'

a(S'Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, fresh from its demerger from Hanson Plc in October, said on Monday it was capable of cutting back debt levels and investing in further export growth as a dual policy.\nGareth Davis, chief executive, told Reuters in an interview that the two could be achieved "in parallel" because of the group\'s strong cash generation. In particular, Davis revealed Imperial was in talks with a Japanese company about entering the market for the first time. He also said the group would keep open the option of a share buyback in the future.  \nImperial inherited around 1.1 billion stg of debt as its legacy from the Hanson family break-up. But Davis said this did not hamper the group\'s plans to seek distribution deals or joint ventures in the overseas cigarette markets and possibly examine small acquisition deals in the fragmented cigar market.\nHe added that if an important larger-sized acquisition opportunity came up he would be prepared to raise debt levels, but for the moment "the priority is to get it down. Our situation, our ability to generate cash means we can do things in parallel - pay down debt and pay for acquisitions...Bolt-on acquisitions are more likely in the cigar area," he added.  \nOn the Japanese market in particular, Davis told Reuters "We are looking to do something in Japan. We are actively considering this. In one way or another we will establish a presence in that market," admitting that talks were underway with one party.\nBut he sought to reassure shareholders that Imperial would not squander its sound financial inheritance in its bid to catch up in the overseas field. "In our international expansion plans I would not dream of being a balance sheet wrecker," he said. If Imperial failed to find the right deals, it would be prepared to conside other options to return value, he said.  \nIf a possible acquisition fails to offer sufficient rates of return "we would say: what would a share buyback do to enhance shareholder value, rather than a potential acquisition?"\n"A buyback is something we\'d never rule out. Given our cash flow characteristics people tend to say "What are you going to do with all that cash.\'"\nImperial reports its first set of results since the Hanson demerger on December 5 when it will give a trading update of the first few months since its split.\nDavis said he expected the UK market to continue to decline at around 2 percent next year.  \nBut the international business, accounting for 17 percent of profits in the first eight months of the year, s expected to show continued rapid growth.\n"I would be very disappointed if it wasn\'t 25 percent by 2,000." The last two years have seen overseas sales double, but Davis drew the line at hitting his target by 1997.\n"That would be overstating it (our confidence). But the signs are the business is showing strong growth."\nDespite his caution, Davis has said that the company has already clinched a deal with unions to add a third shift from May 1997 which has the potential to raise capacity at its Nottingham factory  by one third.\nImperial says if a number of overseas deals start feeding through it will be ready to meet the surge in demand.\nThe third shift could, in theory, raise Imperial\'s total cigarette production to 53 billion from the existing 37 billion mark.\n--London newsroom +44 171 5427717\n'

a(S'Eurotunnel Plc, the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator, said on Tuesday that its traffic will be cut to one third of normal levels after a fire swept through one of its main tunnels on Monday night, injuring eight people.\nServices have been terminated until the tunnel affected is cleared. A Eurotunnel spokesman in London said there was no fixed time for when services would resume or how long reduced capacity will operate once the tunnel is opened.\nNews of the fire and worries about the extent of damage and a resultant safety review hit Eurotunnel\'s shares in both London and Paris.\nThe fire is the latest issue to dog Eurotunnel\'s performance which has been plagued by negotiations to rejig nine billion pounds ($15 billion) in debt.\nIn London, Eurotunnel shares fell 3-1/2 pence to 88 pence while in Paris the stock was down around two percent at 7.68 francs per share. But trading in its debt was barely changed.\nCommenting on the initial impact on traffic, a Eurotunnel spokesman in London said, "We will operate at one third of normal capacity and we will give priority to Eurostar (passenger) trains. But there will still be space for shuttle trains as well."\nHe did not say how many Eurostar or Le Shuttle trains would be cancelled as a result.\nThe Tunnel\'s operations were closed after a fire engulfed part of one of two tunnels, near to Calais where parties from France and Britain had been holding a safety conference.\nThe Eurotunnel spokesman said it did not yet know the full extent of damage to rolling stock or the tunnel itself or how much it could cost, but admitted it was a "very ferocious fire."\n"It\'s quite messy down there. There will be damage to the overhead powerline cables, the heat will have buckled the steel rails and the carriages involved would be very badly damaged and may need to be replaced," he said.\nThe cost of a new train is 25 million pounds, but Eurotunnel did not think an entire train would need replacing. But Eurotunnel faces costs in repairing tunnel and rolling stock damage and may face compensation costs, possibly involving paying for customers to travel by ferry or air.\nThe company said at this stage that it does not know the cause of the fire. But unconfirmed media reports say the fire began in a truck carrying inflammable polystyrene.\nThe heavy goods vehicle shuttles are known to have partially open sides -- the safety of which had been questioned by the British fire brigade some years before.\nMike Frattini, fire officer and spokesman for the Kent Fire Brigade which helped put out the tunnel fire, said earlier: "Our chief officer warned the safety committee (for the tunnel) five years ago."\nFire fighters could raise this objection again as part of the investigation which will go to the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority.\nIf the current goods carriages are deemed to be hazardous in light of the accident there could be a call for changes, incurring further costs to Eurotunnel.\nEurotunnel\'s spokesman refused to comment on whether changes will need to be made to carriages, adding that "It is a key question."\nThe fire comes just before Christmas when the tunnel was expected to see a surge in holiday sales. But pre-holiday publicity now consists of media reports of choking people emerging from smoke and "blow-torch"-like heat.\nAsked whether this would dampen customer demand, Eurotunnel said "We hope not. But what\'s happened has happened and how the fire was handled should renew confidence in our safety procedures," said the press officer.\nOne analyst at Natwest Securities said there should be little further impact on shares or consumer confidence.\nShares in cross-channel ferry operator P&amp;O were five pence higher at 602-1/2p.\n($1=.5970 Pound)\n'

a(S'Stagecoach, the British bus and rail group which has seen its share price grow fivefold in three years, Thursday posted a bumper 127 percent rise in first-half profits, boosting its stock to a record high.\nThe Scottish-based group, which has enjoyed explosive growth since its flotation in 1993, said half year pre-tax profits climbed to a record 47 million pounds ($79 million). The half year dividend rose 43 percent to 3 pence (5 cents) a share and group revenues leapt to 405 million pounds ($679.0 million) from 198.8 million ($333.3 million).\nChairman Brian Souter called the results excellent.\nShares in Stagecoach were up 45.5 pence (76.28 cents) at 629 ($10.54) by 1350 GMT (8:50 a.m. EST), leading a fleet of other bus companies higher in its wake. Go-Ahead Group rose 15 pence to 411.5 ($6.90) and Cowie Group added 5.5 pence (9.2 cents) to 396p ($6.63).\n"It\'s good news all round. The profits are two million ($3.4 million) above what I expected. We\'re upgrading our year forecast by five million ($8.4 million) to 97 million pounds ($162.6 million)," said UBS analyst Richard Hannah.\nThe results were the first since the group\'s high profile acquisitions of British rail rolling stock company Porterbrook and the Swedish bus group Swebus.\n"The integration of Porterbrook and Swebus is proceeding and I am confident of a successful outcome," said Souter.\nPorterbook and the bus operations were the real driver behind the growth in profits. The figures were also flattered by a one-off gain of 15 million pounds ($25.1 million) from the sale of a 21.7 percent stake in Strathclyde Buses. This was reflected in the high half-year payout.\nPorterbook\'s profits were better than expected at 13.5 million pounds ($22.6 million) in the six weeks since it was acquired.\n"That\'s about two million ($3.4 million) profit a week on operating profit margins of 40 percent," said Hannah.\nStagecoach finance director Keith Cochrane said operating profits would ease slightly in the latter part of the year as the company took on "on-going expenditure for maintenance."\nHe forecast Porterbrook would still perform strongly, although margins would not be as high as in the first six weeks.\nTotal sales in the bus operation rose to 232.2 million pounds ($389.3 million) against 189.2 million ($317.2 million), yielding profits of 34.6 million ($58 million) versus 29.0 million ($48.6 million).\nSouth West Trains, a new business, saw sales of 128 million pounds ($214.6 million) and profits of 500,000 pounds ($838,222).\nPorterbrook sales were 33.6 million pounds ($56.3 million), with 13.5 million ($22.6 million) profit and Swebus sales came in at 11.3 million ($18.9 million), with 600,000 pounds ($1 million) in profit.\nStagecoach, which started out as a brother and sister team in Scotland, was floated in 1993 at 112 pence ($1.87) a share. The share price has doubled this year.\n'

a(S'H&amp;R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least for now.\nThe Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earlier this year, cited CompuServe\'s recent financial troubles and uncertainties facing the online industry.\nIndustry analysts said the problems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than half of them outside of the United States.\nAmerica Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services.\nSome analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of specialised information as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain.\n"A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky," said one analyst who follows the industry.\nH&amp;R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.\nBut it said Wednesday that it has decided not to present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.\n"The board continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&amp;R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter," H&amp;R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said.\nCompuServe\'s stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday\'s announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&amp;R Block will not come onto the market.\nCompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&amp;R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.\nIn July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company.\nThe company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.\nIn response, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service\'s prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.\nWhen the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October.\nH&amp;R Block, which is also the nation\'s largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said.\nIn addition to the losses, H&amp;R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.\nMeanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace.\n"The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months," one analyst said.\n'

a(S'Promising the computer industry equivalent of universal harmony, a U.S.-based start-up formed by a brain trust of Israeli computer scientists Monday unveiled a technology that promises to overcome barriers dividing users of rival software programs.\nAnysoft Inc. said its set of software technologies allows computer users to manipulate information from any application while retaining all formatting and other properties.\nThe system functions as an underlying layer of operating system software, but independent of any one operating system. An operating system controls the basic functions of a computer. Anysoft officials asserted the system can handle text, numerical data, graphical images, video and other data, including information available only at remote Internet sites.\n"This is the beginning of true software interoperability," Anysoft Chief Executive Illan Poreh said in a statement. "For the first time, all applications, including those that have not incorporated the ANY Technologies, will work together."\nThe private Cambridge, Mass.-based firm is backed by Bank Leumi, Israel\'s largest bank, and 21 private investors, including several senior executives at modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp..\nIn an interview, Anysoft founder Poreh said the company\'s team of software programmers was handpicked from among top professors and graduate students at leading Israeli universities, including Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology.\nIndustry analysts briefed on the technology hailed it as a decisive breakthrough, based on its potential to liberate computer users from dependence on any single operating system, such as Microsoft Corp.\'s Windows.\n"This is certainly one of the most significant technologies I\'ve seen in the past five years," said veteran industry analyst Tim Bajarin, who heads Creative Strategies, a San Jose, Calif.-based consulting firm.\n"What Anysoft has done is taken software interoperability beyond a forced Windows-X86 environment," Barjarin said, referring to the ruling combination of Microsoft software and Intel Corp. software and hardware systems.\nNonetheless, Anysoft\'s audacious goal is set against a history of failed industry attempts to create a universally accepted format capable of handling all types of computer data.\nIn recent years, leading computer makers like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have rallied around a common software compabability standard known as CORBA.\nHowever, this and similar initiatives have been hamstrung by competitive rivalries among industry players and the belief that programmers must unify around a single standard for creating software.\nMicrosoft\'s own effort at ushering in a "Golden Age" of software compatability has gone by several names, such as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and ActiveX, its Internet-based compatability standard.\nBut Microsoft\'s efforts have met with foot-dragging by companies unwilling to cede the software giant any more standard-setting power than it already has.\nBy contrast, the ANY concept is based on the seemingly simple idea that the only univeral information from different operating systems is what computer users see displayed on a screen.\n"The screen is the only standard that everyone is using," Poreh maintained.\nAnysoft has created software extensions that give computer users the perception of compatibility without having to address underlying programming differences that have ensnared previous efforts, he said.\nAnysoft\'s go-it-alone strategy depends on seeding its technology widely among software companies, Internet service providers and large corporations developing their own software applications, all of which might include Anysoft\'s universal data routing features in their own products.\nConsumers would have to wait until products using the technology become available from these companies.\nPoreh said he plans to charge companies using Anysoft technology in their products a licensing fee starting at around $20,000 and running up to $400,000, depending on the potential number of users of the product.\nIn addition, Poreh said Anysoft plans to ask for a royalty of 1 percent to 3 percent, or a flat fee, again depending on the potential number of customers.\nANY technology is designed to extend software systems such as Windows or Lotus Notes, and existing compatibility programs such as Adobe Systems Inc.\'s  Acrobat, Sun Microsystems Inc.\'s Java or even the Internet, rather than replace them, Anysoft officials said.\nAnysoft said it has held licensing talks with five of the world\'s top 10 independent software development companies, including IBM.\nPoreh said IBM\'s main interest appeared to be in using ANY technology to recover data from so-called "legacy" applications running on older mainframe computers where the underlying software is no longer being actively maintained.\nANY technology currently works with software running on Microsoft\'s Windows operating systems. The technology is in the process of being made compatible with Apple Computer Inc.\'s Macintosh, IBM\'s OS/2 and the Unix-based X/Windows operating system, company officials said.\n'

a(S'Semiconductor equipment stocks surged Friday on fresh signs the downturn in the chip industry has hit bottom, and the buying spilled over into some computer chip makers as well.\nInvestors jumped in after the leading maker of equipment used to produce computer chips, Applied Materials Inc., gave support to the growing consensus in the industry that the market for chip-making machinery would turn up in 1997.\nApplied Materials on Thursday reported lower earnings for the latest quarter but also said that even at the low point in the current technology spending cycle, it expected profit margins to stay higher than in prior downturns.\nThat was enough for investors to rush in, even while the industry\'s profits have yet to start a meaningful rebound. Semiconductor equipment stocks are often seen by investors as bellwethers for the next wave of technology growth.\n"Now we have an indication out of Applied Materials that the bottom is not as deep as some may have worried or suggested," said Deutsche Morgan analyst Elliott Rogers, who was one of several analysts to raise Applied to "buy" from "hold" Friday.\nApplied Materials stock surged $6.625 to $38.625 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue with more than 21 million shares traded.\nIn addition to Applied Materials, KLA Instruments Corp. rallied $5 to $38.25, Tencor Instruments rose $5.50 to $26.75, and Lam Research Corp. increased $4.625 to $34.125.\nThe four equipment stocks were among Nasdaq\'s 10 most active, while Intel Corp., the world\'s biggest chip maker, rose $3.125 to $122.\nOther chip equipment makers also rose, including PRI Automation Inc., up $6.375 to $42.875, and Novellus Systems Inc., up $8 to $57.875.\nAfter the market closed Thursday, Applied Materials said profits fell 53 percent to $73.1 million, or 40 cents a share, for its fourth fiscal quarter, which was about in line with expectations.\nBut Wall Street analysts widely believe a new chapter has begun to unfold for the chip industry, which could lead to a rebound in orders for production equipment.\nThe recovery is expected since sales of personal computers appear to be picking up, which means renewed demand for additional chip-making equipment cannot far behind. PCs soak up about half of all semiconductors produced worldwide.\nThe chip industry over the years has become notorious for its boom-to-bust cycles. Many now argue that the latest year-long slow-down in semiconductor equipment spending has stabilised, leaving the industry poised to begin another of its cyclical upturns early next year.\nThis could come even after chip makers aggressively built plants and added capacity last year, which flooded the market and led to a glut of chip inventory earlier this year.\nAlex. Brown analyst Byron Walker said that during a conference call Thursday, Applied Materials executives said they saw equipment order rates stabilising.\nBut while Walker upgraded Applied Materials and other stocks in the group, he cautioned the companies might be hurt next year by a continued glut of computer memory chips, the biggest category of semiconductors.\n'

a(S'Flextronics International Inc Chief Executive Michael Marks said he expects revenues of around $1 billion during fiscal 1998, more than double the $500 million expected in the fiscal 1997 year ending in March.\nMarks was responding to the nose-dive in Flextronics stock price Wednesday morning that send the stock down 12-1/4 to 25. The sharp decline came after the company announced a restructuring plan that is likely to dampen near-term profits.\n"We are going to more than double our revenues next year... to somewhere around $1 billion," Marks said.  \n"There is nothing but good news here," Marks told Reuters by phone from San Jose, Calif.. He was referring to the company\'s business prospects going forward.\nHe said Flextronics\' restructuring was designed to allow it to continue to gain market share and position for it for annual earnings growth of 35-40 percent through the year 2000.\n"Next year we will be third in the market by revenues," Marks said, rising from its current fourth place position. Only SCI Systems Inc and Solectron Corp remain larger, he said. "We are on fire as a company," he added.  \nThe executive blamed the volatility of the Nasdaq market and the departure of momentum players who had invested in his company recently for the tumble in Flextronic stock price.\nIn particular, he said the sell-off was sparked Wednesday when sellers dumped a relatively small volume of about 80,000 shares, creating the downward spiral in the stock price.\n"It\'s one of the reasons why everyone thinks about getting out of Nasdaq," Marks said.  \nAsked if he considered the stock a buy at current levels, he declined to comment.\nIn a statement released earlier, Flextronics said its restructuring would include charges of $5 to $7 million spread over the December and March quarters, to "prepare for accelerated growth over the next several years."\nThe company also said it had told analysts in a briefing Tuesday of new contract wins with Ascend Communications Inc, Harris Corp\'s Communications unit and Philips Electronics NV.\nWith Ascend in particular, he said the company would be manufacturing the company\'s mainstream MAX TNT remote access network equipment. "We expect (Ascend) will be one of our top 10 customers," Marks said.\nThese latest wins follow a recent $350 million contract win with Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, bolstering its already strong activity in the contract manufacturing of telecommuncation and data communciation products, he said.\nOther major customers include Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and LifeScan Inc, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson.\nFlextronics is Singapore based.\n-- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736\n'

a(S'Shiva Corp. stock lost almost half its value Wednesday after the data communications equipment maker stunned Wall Street by revealing that fourth-quarter earnings were likely to be no more than a third of expectations.\nThe company\'s stock plunged $15.625, or 45 percent, to $19.25 on Nasdaq after it said late on Tuesday it expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996 to be between 5 cents and 7 cents a share.\nThat would be sharply below consensus estimates of 21 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts\' estimates. Twenty-four million shares exchanged hands, making it the day\'s most actively traded issue.\nSecurities analysts said the earnings shortfall triggered the massive sell-off, but that the decline was accelerated by plans by company officials to make changes in Shiva\'s business strategy that analysts said could imperil earnings further.\n"I think the drop was to a large extent a reaction in the stock to the warning of lower earnings," said Smith Barney analyst Therese Murphy. "But I think when people sit back they are also going to be concerned about the change in strategy."\nIn a brief statement released after the markets closed on Tuesday, the Bedford, Mass.-based company said the shortfall was based on preliminary calculations.\nChief Financial Officer Cynthia Deysher said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the shortfall was mainly due to weakness in domestic sales and a decision by International Business Machines Corp. to delay an order during the quarter.\n"We didn\'t receive the Q4 (order) from IBM," Deysher said. IBM is a key reseller of Shiva\'s networking products. She also said the company did not ship as much product as it expected in the quarter.\nThe Shiva official said the company would take steps to address the shortfall, including reorganizing its sales force.\nDeysher said Shiva had renegotiated terms of its strategic alliance with Canada\'s Northern Telecom Ltd., a move she said is likely to cause revenues to decline but profit margins to rise, ensuring it can still meet its earnings goals.\nDeysher said NorTel will assume the costs of manufacturing products resulting from the alliance and cover a larger share of the partnership\'s research and development costs.\nShiva\'s switching equipment is one piece of a larger Northern Telecom communications system that allows remote callers such as telecommuters or traveling sales staff to dial into central office computers.\n"We felt it would be more profitable because we are moving to a royalty arrangement" with Nortel, Deysher said. Shiva will be paid a percentage of sales instead of for each product it builds, as called for under the prior terms of the alliance.\nBefore its fall from grace, many Wall Street analysts classified Shiva as one of the fast-growing companies best-positioned to participate in the massive demand for network equipment used to build the Internet\'s infrastructure.\nWhile executives said they remained confident Shiva could make up the lost ground in future quarters and still meet the Wall Street consensus expectation of $1.06 per share for fiscal 1998, Wall Street analysts refused to buy the argument.\nAnalysts slashed earnings estimates well below company forecasts and those who had not previously done so downgraded their ratings on the stock. Most advised investors to dispose of shares and remain on the sidelines until Shiva shows concrete evidence it can meet earnings targets again.\nAccording to First Call, of nine Wall Street analysts who follow the company, seven cut earnings forecasts and or stock ratings on Shiva.\nIn spite of Shiva\'s optimism long-term, the new earnings consensus for the year ending January 1998 of the seven analysts was $0.83 per share, down from $1.07 previously.\nMurphy said that even if Shiva\'s plans to focus on its newer switching equipment products succeed, it faces stiff competition from larger rivals like Ascend Communications Inc., Cascade Communications Corp. and U.S. Robotics Inc.\n"I didn\'t encourage people to bottom-fish on this correction," she said, referring to her recommendation to brokerage clients.\n"When you miss numbers as significantly as they did, it draws a lot of different questions," said Matt Barzowskas, an analyst for First Albany. "You get a lot more conservative."\n"After a quarter like this you have to just step back and evaluate," Barzowskas said. "I am not ready to believe they can do what they think they can do at the moment."\nBut while he slashed his earnings estimates for the foreseeable future, the First Albany analyst maintained his buy rating on the stock at its now severely reduced price.\nShiva said it expected revenue for the three months ending Dec. 28 to be $48 million to $50 million, compared with $57.1 million for the prior quarter, which ended in September. The company reported $35.6 million in revenues for the fourth quarter of 1995.\nShiva said it will report final results for the fourth quarter and year on Jan. 23 after the close of the market.\n'

a(S'Japan\'s biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities, posted a hefty half-year loss on Tuesday but other "Big Four" brokers turned in handsome profits due to improving business on the nation\'s stock market.\nNomura suffered a net parent loss of around $3 billion in the six months to September 30 after ploughing large amounts of money into helping an ailing finance firm in the Nomura group.\nHowever, the three other big brokers posted healthy profits generally in line with their performance for the same period last year, helped by rising turnover on the Japanese stock market. The brokers have troubled affiliates too but have yet to work out detailed strategies for tackling the problem.\nExecutives at Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities all said their firms had benefited from increased stockbroking fees and commission income from bond and stock underwriting.\nDespite the net losses, analysts said Nomura was on track for better-than-expected profits this year, which would make it easier to resolve financial woes in the Nomura Group.\nIn the first half, Nomura\'s parent current profit stood at 69.87 billion yen ($618 million), more than double its 32.16 billion yen ($284 million) first-half profit a year earlier.\nHowever, it reported a loss of 337.54 billion yen ($2.98 billion) on a net basis after providing financial support worth 371 billion yen ($3.28 billion) to the non-bank affiliate.\nParent current profit is pre-tax, and includes losses and gains on non-operating activities. Net profit is after-tax and includes extraordinary profits or losses.\nNomura\'s Vice President Atsushi Saito said there were no complaints from customers and shareholders about its decision to support the affiliate. Credit rating agencies have been positive about the decision as it shows a willingness to confront the problem, he said.\nNomura wants to boost its operating profits for the latter half of 1996/97 to offset the half-year net loss, he added.\nMeanwhile, Hiromitsu Sogame, vice president of Japan\'s second-biggest broker Daiwa, said that the company wants to provide support to its non-bank affiliate in the current business year on a lump-sum basis and was working on a plan with tax officials and accountants.\nIn the first half, Daiwa\'s parent current profit rose 3.7 percent to 28.55 billion yen ($252 million). It was also in profit on a net basis. Sogame said the affiliate needs to write off more than 100 billion yen ($884 million) worth of bad assets and Daiwa will use profits from sales of shareholdings, internal reserves and current profits to provide the aid.\nMasao Yuki, the vice president of third biggest broker Nikko, said the company was also considering financial support to several non-bank affiliates. However, he said one of the troubled units was jointly owned by Asahi Bank and it would take time to work out a plan.\nRyuji Shirai, deputy president at Yamaichi Securities, said his firm is expected to revise an existing restructuring plan for its non-bank financial affiliate to cut the period covered by the scheme from the current 10 years.\nNikko\'s parent current profits fell slightly to 22.23 billion yen ($196 million) in the first half from 25.53 billion yen ($225 million) in the year-earlier period.\nParent current profits at Yamaichi, the last of the "Big Four", rose 23 percent to 6.44 billion yen ($56.9 million) in the April-September period. Its net profit also rose.\nNomura and Daiwa did not give earnings forecasts but Nikko said that it expected a parent current profit of 60 billion yen ($530 million) in 1996/97, and Yamaichi said it projected a profit totalling 19 billion yen ($168 million).\n'

a(S'A bill to lift a 50-year-old ban on holding companies is expected to be submitted to Japan\'s next parliament, with passage almost assured because of the government\'s "Big Bang" deregulation plans, economists say.\nThey added the financial industry would likely be the one which benefits first as the lifting of the ban would help it restructure and bail out troubled financial institutions.\nPolitical haggling has delayed a decision on the holding companies ban for almost a year.\nBut the economists said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto\'s plans to liberalise the financial markets by 2001 and the proposed breakup of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) mean the ban will likely be lifted.\nA holding company is a firm which controls one or more companies, often by having a majority of shares in them, but does not engage in a specific business.\nBig business has demanded for years that the ban be lifted, and the pressure on the government has increased recently as many companies push for deregulation to help them streamline and compete with overseas rivals.\nThe plan to break up NTT calls for it to be restructured into three firms under a holding company. The firm had resisted the break-up plans until the holding company option was offered.\nU.S. occupation forces introduced the ban on holding companies in 1947 to break up powerful conglomerates, known as "zaibatsu", which the United States said had contributed to Japan\'s war effort.\n"I am sure the ban will be relaxed broadly in line with ideas the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been advocating," said Hideo Fujiwara, senior research fellow at LTCB Research Institute Inc.\nThe Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the anti-monopoly watchdog, said last week it plans to submit a bill to end the ban to the session of parliament which starts in January.\nLast January, the FTC sought to revise the Anti-Monopoly Law to broadly remove the ban, which had the backing of the pro-business LDP.\nBut that failed when the Social Democratic Party, a member in the then-ruling coalition, called for only a partial lifting of the ban.\nIf the bill passes next year, the ban would be relaxed by October 1997 at the earliest.\n"Even if the ban is lifted, not many companies will make use of the new corporate structure immediately," Fujiwara said.\nCompanies such as Sony Corp, Canon Inc and Asahi Glass Co Ltd may be able to establish holding companies as they have already split their operations, he said, but many other companies have not.\nBut financial companies are in a better position to take advantage of the change, some economists said.\n"Holding companies will enable banks, brokers and insurers to break down barriers between them," said Yushiro Ikuyo, a first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc.\nIkuyo said a holding company would make it easy for a big financial institution to streamline its corporate group, in particular, bailing out an ailing financial firm in the group.\nThe economists also said regional banks which tie up under a holding company would be able to boost their coverage areas.\nSome warn, however, that financial holding companies would not solve all the problems facing the financial industry, in which too many deposit-taking institutions are competing.\n"Like the recently collapsed Hanwa Bank, not all failed financial institutions can be bailed out through a holding company," LTCB Research\'s Fujiwara said.\nThe Finance Ministry last month suspended most operations at Hanwa and will eventually wind down the regional bank, which collapsed under the weight of its problem loans.\n'

a(S'Share trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange could more than triple to a billion shares a day, once deregulation is decided and implemented, a senior official of the Finance Ministry said.\nAtsushi Nagano, director general of the ministry\'s securities bureau, said he is resolved to make Tokyo a more attractive place to do securities business.\n"It is not just a dream to boost the volume on Tokyo\'s stock market to one billion shares if we make the Tokyo market more attractive," Nagano told Reuters in an interview.\nNagano declined to discuss details of possible changes in regulations, but financial industry sources said some of the measures on the agenda are: - deregulation of brokers\' commissions on smaller lots, - further breaking down the wall separating banks and securities houses, - allowing sales of investment trusts at bank counters.\nOn Friday, turnover on the exchange\'s first section was about 381 million shares, compared with a scant 225 million on Thursday. Daily turnover has averaged 300 million to 400 million in the past two years.\nNagano, whose bureau is responsible for overseeing the nation\'s securities markets and industry, said the industry has no choice but to open up to all investors from around the world in line with global standards.\nNow recovering a little from a slump in business after the collapse of the "bubble" economy of inflated stock and asset prices of the late 1980s, the securities industry has begun to consider its future, although it is still somewhat vulnerable, he said.\nIn the past when turnover on the stock market dwindled, the government had thought of remedies such as increasing public spending, but this would not work any more, he said.\nShare trading on the exchange was worth $889 billion last year, while that in New York stood at $3.08 trillion, data from the Finance Ministry show.\nTrading volume of Nikkei 225 index futures on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) plunged to 7.22 million lots or contracts in 1995 compared with 21.64 million in 1991, while that on the Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SIMEX) surged to 3.16 million lots from only 361,000 in 1991.\nMarket sources said declining turnover of Nikkei 225 index futures was attributable to tougher trading rules the Finance Ministry imposed after the bubble burst in the early 1990s.\nIn June, an advisory panel to the Finance Minister, the Securities and Exchange Council, established a special committee to debate reform in the securities markets, the industry and securities policy management.\nNagano said he wanted the committee to discuss wide-ranging issues which have impeded development of Japan\'s securities markets. "I believe there is a lot of room to expand for this (securities) industry. While investors and borrowers need each other, there are some obstacles to matching (the needs of the two sides)."\nNagano said he did not want the committee to go into individual measures hurriedly without deep discussions about the problems facing the markets and the industry.\n"It may take one or two months from now before discussions of individual issues start," he added.\nThe committee is expected to make proposals next June.\n'

a(S'Faced with persistent market rumours that it is on the verge of collapse, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd went public on Wednesday to say that any such talk is "totally groundless".\n"In the markets, unsourced rumours such as the suggestion that our bank is practically on the verge of collapse are circulating and are prompting sales of our shares and debentures," NCB vice president Shoji Nishikawa told a hastily convened news conference.\n"Such rumours are totally groundless and our bank would like to declare that these rumours are not true," he said.\nFinance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka also came out in support of long-suffering Nippon Credit, whose failure could spark a crisis in the banking industry.\nHe said the government will fully support the bank, although he added that the ministry is not worried about the financial health of Nippon Credit, the smallest of the nation\'s three long-term credit banks.\n"The ministry has had no worries about the bank. It (the bank) is doing its utmost to improve its management. We don\'t believe that the bank will collapse as some media reports have said," Mitsuzuka told reporters at his regular news conference.\nNippon Credit\'s latest ordeal began early Wednesday when traders began to sell its shares on vague talk that NCB would hold an emergency news conference. There was also a vague rumour about a possible merger involving NCB, they said.\nThe dumping of the bank\'s shares ignited renewed selling throughout the banking sector. The sharp fall in banking shares has been largely to blame for the tumble in the Tokyo stock market since mid-December.\nNippon Credit shares fell 35 yen (28 cents) to close on Wednesday at an all-time low of 181 yen ($1.47).\nIn the bond market, NCB\'s latest debentures are selling at a yield of 4.1 percent, a full 2.5 percentage points above bonds issued by other banks, reflecting the perceived risk in its debts.\nNishikawa said the sell-off was influenced by exaggerated media reports which hyped concerns over the health of Japan\'s financial system.\n"We believe the market condition has deviated greatly from the realities of the bank. We hope market participants will calm down," he said.\nHe also said the bank would be able to post a current profit in 1996/97 even after disposing of problem loans as it had planned -- if Tokyo stock prices remain at their current levels.\nLike other banks, NCB relies on its own share holdings to help provide needed cash so as the stock market tumbles, its situation worsens. That has created a vicious circle for the Tokyo stock market.\nThe bank plans to write off problem loans of 130 billion yen ($1.05 billion) in the current fiscal year ending March 31. As of the end of September, such problem loans totalled 1.39 trillion yen ($11.3 billion).\nSome analysts said that it is unclear whether the news conference by NCB and the finance ministry\'s pledge to support the bank would help regain confidence in Japan\'s banking sector.\n"In the long-term, the banking sector will remain under pressure until Japan completes its \'Big Bang\' financial reforms," said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.

a(S'Japan\'s depressed real estate market is unlikely to get much immediate help for its problems despite market euphoria over possible state purchases of land once owned by troubled financial firms, analysts said.\nTokyo\'s key stock index surged on Thursday, led by property-related issues, after a newspaper report saying the government was considering using public funds to buy collateralised land formerly owned by failed mortgage firms and other troubled financial firms.\nThe index, the Nikkei 225, ended up 2.43 percent at 19,051.71, its first close above 19,000 points for more than a month.\nA Finance Ministry official told Reuters a government panel was considering using funds already set aside in the next state budget to buy land formerly owned by troubled financial firms.\nVice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa later confirmed the possibility, telling a news conference it was possible public-sector firms may purchase such land.\nHe said the plan would help ease the liquidity crisis affecting real estate.\nA government panel, whose members include officials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency, was set up last October to tackle the tough issue of collecting problem loans for which land is being held as collateral.\nAt present, firms cannot afford to sell at market levels since they would realise their huge losses caused by the collapse of the "bubble" economy early this decade.\nThis has led to stagnation in the real estate market and kept the massive problem hanging over the whole financial sector.\n"The panel has been discussing how to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans," said an official at a bank involved in the discussions.\n"But we have not talked about any details yet."\nHowever, he said that if the government decided to buy such collateralised land, it would have a positive impact since the private sector remained reluctant to buy land.\nJesper Koll, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Asia, said public land buying was not a new initiative and no new funds were likely to be allocated for the purchases.\nHowever, he said that more important than any public purchases was Hashimoto\'s promise to speed up the process of turning real estate into equity assets.\n"The faster banks and real estate companies are allowed to securitise property assets, the greater their prospects for increased income generation," he said. "Prime Minister Hashimoto is getting serious about fixing Japan\'s real estate problem sooner, not later."\nYoshinobu Yamada, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said that while the move by the government panel on land was not a new initiative, it would have a positive impact in the long-term.\n"The government is well aware that it must take steps to stop falling land prices," he said, adding that a lack of land liquidity was at the core of Japan\'s bad-loan mess.\n"If the government buys collateralised land formerly owned by jusen, this is likely to give psychological support to the the real estate markets and help the markets bottom out."\nHowever, he said no concrete policy steps would be available until March so that the current euphoria on the Tokyo\'s stock market could be only a passing fancy.\n'

a(S'China\'s cautious and much-delayed experiment with convertible bonds as a way of raising corporate funds is expected to move forward next year with up to 6-10 foreign currency issues, brokers and analysts said on Wednesday.\nChinese securities authorities have said on a number of occasions they want to conduct test issues of convertible bonds, which give holders an option to convert the debt into stock.\nOnly a small handful of cases have been tried so far with very mixed results. But analysts said they believed authorities were increasingly taking a favourable attitude towards the concept of convertible bonds.\nThis is reflected in the many listed Chinese firms which have said in recent months they are considering or planning to launch bonds convertible into their foreign currency B shares, listed on China stock markets, or H shares listed in Hong Kong.\n"The prospects for convertible bonds next year look good," said a senior analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. "I would say there could be up to 10 issues in 1997. The process has been slower than expected, but China has a need for more funds."\n"There\'s a lot of momentum on convertible bonds at present," said John Crossman, general manager of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai. "We\'ve been pushing the concept with companies and officials and it\'s now taken on a momentum of its own."\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is believed to have received a pile of applications for such issues but is cautious about proceeding partly because of a number of unsuccessful past attempts at issuing convertible bonds.\n"China Textile Machinery\'s issue of convertible bonds, for instance, was a disaster," said the senior analyst. "Nobody has converted the bonds to shares, so they have to pay back the money by the end of this year."\nBut a stock analyst in Shenzhen said the market was ready to accept convertible bonds as a concept.\n"The overall financial environment has matured to the point where it\'s possible to look at convertible bonds. But the companies which issue them need to be relatively good to ensure they have the ability to repay," the analyst said.\nHe said the prospect of convertible bonds as a means of raising capital is extremely attractive to China\'s listed companies because, unlike direct equity, it does not immediately dilute earnings.\nThe latest Chinese company to announce a convertible bond is Zhenhai Refining &amp; Chemical Co Ltd which said last month it would issue US$200 million of bonds convertible into the firm\'s H shares.\nOther companies that have indicated an interest include truck maker Qingling Motors Co and Shenzhen-listed Jiangling Motors\nBut the experience of China Textile Machinery indicates that there is risk involved in issuing convertible bonds for companies as well as for investors.\n"The advantage over a straight bond is that the company is placing a bet that it will be able to pay back with shares rather than cash. But there\'s a risk involved," said one foreign analyst.\n"The authorities want to choose large, stable companies that are going to have the cash income to repay the bonds if the conversion proves difficult because of problems with the share price," he added.\n'

a(S'The threat of a Sino-U.S. textiles trade war is having little impact on Chinese firms as it is unlikely to go beyond words and because the companies are performing poorly, company officials and brokers said on Wednesday.\nCompany officials said they had got used to the continual verbal duelling between Beijing and Washington with concrete measures being avoided at the last minute.\n"With the interests of both sides at stake, the verbal warnings will finally be replaced by mutual concessions," said Li Shounan, head of the general manager\'s office in Shanghai Lianhua Fibre Co Ltd.\n"The overall amount under threat is not large and when it comes to an individual company, the impact is even less. We do not expect much effect," said an official with Shanghai Sanmao Textile Co Ltd.\nBut a spokeswoman for Shanghai Jiafeng Co Ltd said its products were involved in the dispute.\n"There will surely be some impact if a trade war breaks out though it is hard to immediately to assess to what extent," she said.\nChina\'s annual apparel and textile exports to the United States are estimated at around $4.2 billion. About 30 garment and textile companies are listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\nIn the most recent clash in Sino-American trade relations, Beijing said on Sunday it would temporarily ban imports of selected U.S. textiles, farm goods, fruits and alcoholic drinks from December 10 in retaliation for U.S. sanctions taken against Chinese textiles.\nWashington announced in September that it would cut China\'s textile import quota for 1995 by $19 million in retaliation after accusing China of shipping through third countries to avoid quotas agreed upon in a bilateral textile accord.\n"Textile companies have performed very poorly in the past two years due to a slump of the industry and we do not expect any major impact even with a trade war," said one broker with China Shandong Securities Co.\n"But a handful of firms closely linked to Chinese-U.S. trade will possibly be affected," he added.\n"Who cares?" said a Shanghai-based investment analyst with a Hong Kong securities brokerage. "They (the listed textile firms) have done so poorly that few investors are interested in them."\nSome Chinese officials have said they believe there is a political agenda behind the U.S. trade threats against China.\n"The U.S. penalties were announced before the U.S. elections and we believe they were closely linked to (U.S. President Bill) Clinton\'s political needs," said one official.\n'

a(S'China unveiled on Tuesday the country\'s first major shipping exchange which it hopes will consolidate and standardise ship chartering and cargo fixing in East China and be a focus for the shipping trade nationwide.\nOfficials told a news conference that all shipping and freight companies in the east China region had been told to move their business as soon as possible to the new Shanghai Shipping Exchange.\nLike the Baltic Exchange in London, the Shanghai Shipping Exchange will allow ship owners and charterers to arrange deals and fix prices for carrying cargoes.\nThe exchange, which has the direct support from the Beijing authorities, has been under preparation for two years and has as its founding members 116 companies, mostly shipping firms in Shanghai and the adjacent provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu.\n"The foundation of the exchange shows the government\'s determination to make Shanghai into an international shipping centre," said Zhang Jinxiang, an official with China\'s biggest shipping firm, COSCO.\n"Other world shipping centres such as London and New York also have such exchanges," Zhang added. "With China\'s fast-growing economy and Shanghai\'s good location, the exchange should help attract more shipping companies here."\nZhu Yongguang, a senior Ministry of Communications official told the news conference that the Shanghai exchange was one of a number of shipping and freight exchanges planned for China.\n"There will be Tianjin in the north, Shanghai in the east, Guangzhou in the south and Wuhan inland. But the focus of the business nationwide will be the Shanghai exchange," he said.\nZhu declined to speculate on how much business the exchange would attract, but said:\n"This will be a gradual thing. The shipping companies (in East China) will be expected to move their business to the exchange, but it won\'t happen overnight."\nMembers of the exchange include ship-owners, mostly state-run companies in Shanghai and surrounding areas, and freight forwarders.\nThe exchange will handle international cargo-fixing, but most of the business in the initial stages is expected to be domestic.\nThe establishment of the exchange was welcomed by an official for Shanghai Haixing Shipping Co, China\'s second-largest shipping company and its largest in domestic trade.\n"The exchange may help cut illegal competition in the shipping market," the official said. "At present, there are some small shipping firms which make use of improper relationships or offer high commissions to get business."\nExchange officials said the exchange was under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai city government and would be treated for the foreseeable future as "experimental", in line with other new markets in China.\n'

a(S'China\'s foreign currency B shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen surged on Wednesday as investors piled in money on the back of rumours the government was planning measures to support the markets, brokers said.\nShanghai\'s B share index soared 5.49 percent to 49.689 points, while the Shenzhen index was up 8.25 percent to 111.35 in heavy trade.\n"There have been widespread talk that regulators are meeting somewhere discussing ways to turn around the long bearishness of the Hong Kong dollar-denominated stock market," a broker at China Southern Securities in Shenzhen said.\n"Such rumours triggered a steady inflow of fresh money," he added.\nIn Shanghai, brokers said the sharp rise was a reflection of the activity in the Shenzhen market with overseas investors buying selected stocks with relatively good prospects.\n"B shares prices had become too cheap to drop any further, with the domestic economic situation improving," one broker said. "And recent rises in Shenzhen B shares also provided a chance for Shanghai B shares to follow."\nIn Shenzhen, brokers and analysts said the recent surges were linked to a report in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times last Thursday that the China Securities Regulatory Commission has been concerned about the market\'s prolonged bearishness.\nThe newspaper quoted the CSRC\'s chairman Zhou Daojiong as saying at an international business forum in Beijing that the poor performance of the country\'s B markets had negatively affected China\'s reform and open policy.\nThe buying is being led by Chinese domestic institutional investors, with increasing amounts of money from overseas investors, said brokers.\n"There is also money coming from Chinese individual investors, but the amount is imposssible to calculate because it\'s illegal," said one analyst.\nChina\'s B shares are supposed to be for foreign investors only, but most of the trading is now done by domestic investors through a variety of means.\nStock analysts were at a loss to come up with suggestions as to what market-boosting measures may be implemented, assuming the rumours of an impending announcement from Beijing are correct.\n"Beyond quietly allowing local Chinese investors to come back into the market, I can\'t think what they could do," said one analyst. "The problem has always been that the companies listed on the B share market are not performing well enough."\nAnother analyst said that the B share market will face a correction over the short term, given the fast pace of its ascent and that its medium-term trend should be decided by whether regulators announced stimulative policies.\n"The rumours are responsible for the current rises but market fundamentals have changed little," said a Shanghai broker. "The upward trend can only be established after concrete governmental measures are announced. Otherwise, it will shortly be reversed."\n'

a(S'China\'s crackdown on stock markets this week is partly fuelled by fears in Beijing that the volatility of the exchanges could lead to social instability, analysts said on Tuesday.\nThey said the move was also aimed at avoiding disruption caused by foreign and domestic speculators planning to pump money into the markets up to the mid-1997 handover of Hong Kong from London to Beijing and then pull it out again.\n"In a transitional period when the ailing leader Deng Xiaoping is gradually moving out of polical arena, social stability is the primary concern of the leadership," said one executive with a Chinese brokerage.\n"Stock boom and bust cycles do not fit in with the aim of social stability," he added.\nA Shenzhen-based broker said there had been many rumours that the surges on the Shenzhen market were supported by overseas funds from Hong Kong and Macau.\n"Some rumours said that foreign funds wanted to push up the Chinese markets before the (Hong Kong) takeover and depress them afterwards," the broker said.\nThe People\'s Daily newspaper, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, said in a harshly-worded commentary on Monday that China\'s stock markets had overheated on widespread speculation. It warned that if the markets crashed, the government would not step in to support them.\nIn anticipation of the response to the commentary, the stock exchanges last Friday evening introduced a 10 percent limit on movements of prices for individual shares.\nOn Monday and again on Tuesday, most shares on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges plunged to the 10 percent limit-down level.\nShanghai\'s domestic A share index lost 100.964 points or 9.64 percent to 946.716 points after falling 9.92 percent on Monday. The B share index shed 1.431 points or 2.39 percent to 58.498 points.\nIn Shenzhen, the A index plummeted 9.99 percent to 375.51 points while the B index dived 9.51 percent, to 121.64 points.\nMost shares hit the daily limit-down of 10 percent shortly after the opening, as on Monday, and stayed there for the whole session, brokers said.\nSince April, both domestic and foreign currency share prices on the two markets have surged on average by well over 100 percent.\n"The central government has chosen the right time," said one political analyst. "There are still a few months to go before the Hong Kong takeover and stock prices had not surged so far that falls would push investors out on to the streets (to demonstrate)."\nSome stock traders said that by talking down the markets, Beijing had effectively prevented heavy fresh liquidity flowing in.\n"The inflow of hot money (speculative funds) has been cut off with retail investors frightened away and institutions taking heed of the warning," one trader said.\n"It seems now that the markets will be stable around the date of the Hong Kong takeover," he added. "Prices are expected to move little after the impact of the crackdown is gradually digested."\n'

a(S'The crackdown on China\'s young stock markets has triggered huge losses in share values and highlighted problems, particularly widespread irregularities and the lack of a regulatory structure, analysts said on Friday.\nThe week of losses on the exchanges in the wake of a Beijing warning on speculation was also a re-run of the age-old Chinese boom-and-bust cycle: controls are relaxed, rule-breaking surges, the screws are tightened and the machine almost breaks.\n"Widespread irregularities are partly a legacy of the old planned economy," said one economist. "But given the power of administrative edicts to influence the markets, some firms have no choice but to resort to irregularities to survive."\nThe sudden announcement of Beijing\'s wrath at the unruly stock markets, expressed in a People\'s Daily commentary on Monday, aimed to dampen speculative trading, but ironically could have the opposite effect, some analysts said.\n"Policy changes have always been a key speculative topic on China\'s stock markets," said one trader. "To regulate the markets with official orders like this time might temporarily depress the speculative mood, but in longer term, it will further add weight to the speculative fever on policy shifts."\nMarket sources said that had Beijing used market means rather than administrative edicts to check the dangerous roller-coaster trend in share trading, the response of the markets would have been much less volatile.\nAs it was, Shanghai\'s domestic A share index plunged 20.07 percent to 922.34 points at the close of Friday\'s trading against Friday\'s close last week, while the foreign currency B index was down 3.84 percent to 63.743 points.\nIn Shenzhen, the A share index nosedived 29.07 percent on the week to 328.96 points, while the B index lost 15.94 percent to 125.56.\n"Most investors are pessimistic about the short-term trend with turnover sharply down this week against last week," said one broker. "We had nearly no new accounts opened this week."\n"The inflow of fresh money into A shares has almost stopped completely," a Shenzhen-based trader said. "Many investors are in despair seeing the price of their shares diving nearly every day."\nAnalysts said the dramatic changes this week sparked reflections on the bust-boom cycle which has dominated China\'s stock markets since they were re-established in 1990.\nAt its height, Shanghai\'s A share index had surged more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart over 300 percent since April when Beijing announced that it supported stock market development.\n"The markets are poorly regulated," said one stock analyst. "One of the reasons for this is the lack of a national securities law governing the stock market."\nThe draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted soon, analysts say.\nIrregularities, including manipulation of selected share prices, have been rife in the Chinese markets for years.\nIn an effort to bring the industry to heel, authorities over the past month have punished branches of nearly all major state-run banks and securities houses for involvement in shady stock dealings.\n'

a(S'China\'s futures markets, which fell deeper into the gloom of official disapproval in 1996, look set for an even tighter year in 1997 with some small exchanges likely to be swallowed by bigger ones, analysts said on Friday.\nThere is still no sign of the long-awaited Futures Law being unveiled, but the analysts said the securities authorities have promised some new regulations in the first half of 1997 to provide a stronger regulatory basis for futures trading.\nThe markets, set up in the early 1990s, quickly became casinos with huge trading on commodities with often very small physical quantities for delivery, making the use of the markets for hedging -- the original purpose -- virtually impossible, analysts said.\nIn the past two years, trading volumes on China\'s futures exchanges have plummeted in the face of a relentless campaign by the securities authorities in Beijing to squeeze speculative activity out of the markets.\n"The official measures, especially the ban on many institutions from trading futures, have pushed large amounts of money out of the markets and dramatically pulled down trading volumes on most exchanges," a local futures analyst said.\nThe Shanghai Metal Exchange, which is the least speculative of the 14 futures exchanges left open, expects total trade volume of 230 billion yuan in 1996, down from 455.8 billion yuan in 1995 and a high of 682 billion yuan in 1994, an exchange official said.\nThe authorities have ruthlessly hounded the speculative "hot money" which used to chase its way round from Suzhou red beans to Zhengzhou green beans and Hainan coffee, and have largely succeeded in killing the enthusiasm of speculators for futures.\nIn March, the China\'s Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) banned securities brokerages, trust and investment firms and state-run enterprises from trading commodities futures, forcing many traders out of the industry, traders said.\nAll commodity futures exchanges have been ordered to cap daily price movements and total holdings.\nIn October, the CSRC also abolished limits on the total amounts of goods for physical delivery, which was used to make it possible for wealthy institutions to build up huge long positions and then short-squeeze the market.\n"Beijing has stressed restrictions rather than development for the futures markets because officials are angry about the repeated violations of rules and rampant irregularities," a local trader for metal futures said.\n"No new money is coming into the futures markets," he added. "There are several safer investment methods, such as stocks and treasure bonds. Why take the extra policy risk?"\n"Few people will pay much more attention to China\'s futures markets until the long-awaited Futures Law is introduced, which will indicate that the government has accepted the industry," a second trader said.\n"It will still take some time for the Futures Law to be completed," a local exchange official said. "But the CSRC has said it will announce five new rules for the industry in the first half of the next year to fill up the regulatory vacuum."\nAnalysts said some of China\'s 14 existing futures exchanges will probably be closed down, merged or taken over in 1997 as the authorities continue their efforts to clean up the industry.\nIt is believed the authorities want to end up with four or five big exchanges.\nIn October, China\'s securities authorities ordered the Changchun United Commodity Exchange to merge with the Beijing Commodity Exchange, which was seen as the first of an expected series of mergers of exchanges, the analysts said.\n"There are too many exchanges in China with most of them trading similar contracts and trading volumes for most contracts are too thin for hedging," a Shanghai-based dealer said.\n'

a(S'Chen Yifei, China\'s top-selling modern artist, is back home in Shanghai, basking in the glow of his international success and planning a shift in subject matter -- this time to illustrate China\'s Generation X.\nThe artist, best known for his almost photographic paintings of Chinese beauties, opened his first-ever retrospective exhibition on Saturday in the new Shanghai Museum.\nThe show, running through to January 19 before going on tour to other cities, is Chen\'s first exhibition in China.\nIt brings together more than 40 works from a variety of public and private sources, including drawings from Chen\'s youth during the 1960s Cultural Revolution, through to his latest paintings depicting the strong faces of Tibetan peasants.\nBut his next artistic goal is to capture on canvas the feel of Chinese urban youth in the mid-1990s, increasingly influenced by trends and concepts from beyond the borders of China, particularly Western culture.\n"I want to do something on the life of the new generation, the ones I see dancing at the Hard Rock Cafe or New York New York (a Shanghai disco)," Chen said in an interview.\n"This is a new generation of China after the revolution. I look at them and I think about the value of life. They look very happy, but maybe thinking a different way," he said.\nMODERN CHINA\'S TOP-SELLING ARTIST\nChen holds the record for the highest price paid at auction for a modern Chinese painting -- 2.86 million yuan ($344,000) for a Tibetan-theme painting called Wind of the Mountain Village, now owned by a Chinese securities firm.\nNow 50 years old, Chen left China in 1980, the first mainland Chinese artist to emigrate to the United States in modern times.\nBut in spirit and in terms of artistic inspiration, he never really left.\nHis most famous paintings so far are a series of life-like portraits of Chinese women dressed in traditional garb, while his paintings reflecting the atmosphere of old Shanghai are well-known.\nHe continues to produce landscapes showing the canals and villages of the east China region that is his ancestral home and looking at his Tibetan portraits, you can almost smell the yak butter.\nChina is also at the heart of his other artistic interest -- making movies. In recent years, he has directed several movies with mixed commercial success but he says he is determined to press on with this branch of the visual arts.\nHe is currently working on three film projects, the first of which will be a documentary on the Jews who lived in Shanghai in the years before the Communist take-over in 1949, most of them refugees from repression in Europe.\nCHINA\'S NEW GENERATION OF ARTISTS\nChen said he was impressed by the standard of younger Chinese artists, particularly in Beijing and Shanghai, but declined to name any favourites.\n"Many of the new generation are very hopeful. China will become very important on the world art market, the standard is really very high," he said.\nHe maintains apartments in New York and Shanghai, but there\'s an important difference.\n"In my heart, Shanghai is my home," he said. "This is where I grew up. In New York, it\'s just a room."\nHe said he was really happy to see Shanghai developing so fast and so strongly.\n"Everyone is watching Shanghai. If it can continue this level of development, this place has a lot of hope."\n'

a(S'North America\'s largest gold producer, Barrick Gold Corp., is negotiating with Canada\'s Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to gain control of Bre-X\'s huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, the companies said Tuesday.\nAcquiring a stake in Busang would set Barrick well on its way to becoming the world\'s biggest gold producer, industry analysts said. It is currently ranked third.\nBarrick has become increasingly aggressive in moving toward its goal, analysts said. Last summer, it acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd. including its promising Pierina gold property in Peru, for about $800 million.\nThe companies were negotiating under the guidance of the Indonesian government, which asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, Bre-X said.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Bre-X discovered Busang, one of the world\'s biggest gold deposits, in 1994.\nOfficial estimates of Busang have outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, but industry analysts have said that number could rise to 100 million ounces.\n"This is a result of Barrick working very hard behind the scenes to circumvent Bre-X\'s sale process," one analyst said. Bre-X has been seeking a partnership with a major gold producer to operate Busang.\nTo satisfy Indonesia, Bre-X would keep 25 percent of its stake and 75 percent would go to Toronto-based Barrick.\nBre-X said the Indonesian government "would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government."\nThe Indonesian government wants Barrick and Bre-X to reach a deal by Dec. 4, or else the government "will take steps to prevent a delay in the development" of Busang, Bre-X said.\nDevelopment of Busang has been held up by disputes between Bre-X and its Indonesian partners over ownership of the discovery. Bre-X, which controls 90 percent of Busang, said it asked Indonesia\'s Mines Ministry if other deals would be acceptable, but had not yet received an answer.\nA deal between the two companies was not a sure thing, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said.\nWith the Indonesian government guiding the Busang negotiations, Bre-X\'s powers to negotiate a favourable deal appear to be curbed, analysts said.\n"There have been some constraints imposed on Bre-X," said analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital Corp. in Montreal. "That\'s going to negatively impact on how much Bre-X can receive for its interest."\nBarrick has an international reputation at stake and will have to be seen as treating Bre-X fairly, analysts said.\n"Given the possible questions that may be raised over how Barrick obtained this special status, it will be essential that they are viewed as treating Bre-X shareholders fairly in any negotiations going forward," said one analyst who asked not to be identified.\nBarrick shares soared on the news, gaining C$2.45 ($1.82) to C$39 ($29.05) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They rose $1.75 to $28.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBre-X shares fell in Toronto before the news and held steady at C$20.35 ($15.16), down C$2.20 ($1.64) afterward. The stock has been volatile lately, clouded by the ownership dispute over Busang.\nIn 1995, Barrick -- already North America\'s largest gold miner -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totalling 43.3 million ounces.\n'

a(S'No final deal was in sight Wednesday for Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp., which are in the midst of forging a deal on one of the world\'s biggest gold deposits -- Indonesia\'s Busang.\nAs a Wednesday deadline slid by, Bre-X and Barrick said they were still trying to hammer out several issues, leaving the market to speculate about the status of negotiations.\nA few issues remain to be solved, and Bre-X will have more news on the negotiations "shortly," Chief Executive David Walsh said in an interview from New York.\nHe said the main issues that stand in the way of a full agreement with Barrick are "regulatory" but maintained he was prevented by a confidentiality agreement to give details.\n"We need certain additional comfort in any agreement that would satisfy the regulatory authorities and our shareholders," he said.\nThe Indonesian government directed Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick by Dec. 4, with Barrick getting 75 percent of Bre-X\'s stake in the rich gold discovery and Bre-X keeping 25 percent. The companies were invited to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent of the rich find.\nAs the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry. It said it expected the Ministry of Mines to clarify its stand on the outstanding issues "in due course."\nThe direction of negotiations is in the hands of the Indonesian government, Walsh said.\n"We are waiting on the answers we get from the Minister of Mines," he said.\nSources close to the talks said Indonesian mining officials had left Jakarta and would not be back until Dec. 9.\n"I think both sides are probably worried about the so-called deadline, which has come and gone," said gold analyst John Ing with Maison Placements Canada Inc. "It\'s back in the lap of the Indonesians."\nIn Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.\n"If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action ... to expedite the development of Busang\'s resouces," Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.\n"What the action will be ... I have to get back to the government. This is not my playground," he added.\nMeanwhile, investors pushed up Bre-X\'s stock C$1.30 to close at C$20.10 ($14.84) in heavy trading in Toronto Wednesday, while Barrick rose C$1.45 to C$39.30 ($29.01).\n"People think there\'s an agreement that will come out sooner rather than later," said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital in Toronto.\nBut she noted that the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations was preventing Bre-X\'s stock from rising to meet the level of rumoured offers of about C$25 ($18.50) a share from Barrick.\n"We\'re actually hearing that (the deal) is done and they\'re just dotting the i\'s and crossing the t\'s," Gignac said. "Everything has been set. We just don\'t know the details."\nBut a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.\nThe latest deadline is the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.\nPossible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X\'s claims, analysts said.\nWaiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.\n"I don\'t think today\'s deadline had any great significance," Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to form a partnership with Bre-X to develop Busang.\n"We\'re not discouraged. It\'s going to be a long process," he said.\nNewmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. also expressed an interest in Busang, which is located deep in the jungle in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.\n'

a(S'Chinese police detained leading dissident Liu Xiaobo on Tuesday after searching his home and confiscating documents in the latest sign of a hardening attitude to the few dissidents still at liberty.\nAbout seven or eight plainclothes and uniformed police, equipped with a search warrant, entered Liu\'s Beijing home at about 8.00 a.m. (0000 GMT), a relative said.\n"They turned the whole place upside-down," she said.\nAfter searching the house and taking books, photographs and documents and articles that Liu had written, police took him away, the relative said. "They took everything."\nThey gave no reason for the detention of Liu, a renowned literary critic who gained fame as a dissident during the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nPolice did not say when Liu might be released. "They gave no reason," the relative said. "They said to wait for notification."\nLiu has been active in recent months, sending open letters to the government to demand press freedom and talks with the Dalai Lama on Tibet.\nOn September 30, Liu and veteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe issued a statement urging China\'s communist authorities to honour a promise in 1945 to give people religious freedom, freedom of the press and speech and to form political parties and stage demonstrations.\nIn a bold move, the two demanded Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin be indicted, impeached and step down for violating the constitution for saying the People\'s Liberation Army was under the "absolute leadership" of the party instead of the state.\nWang Xizhe was still at liberty in southern Guangzhou on Tuesday.\nLiu was last detained by police in 1995 after orchestrating several daring petitions to parliament by groups of dissidents and intellectuals in the early months of the year. He was held for more than seven months without formal charges until being released last January.\nHis detention comes a day after Chinese sources said another dissident, former student leader Wang Dan, faced a second jail term after prosecutors charged him recently with subversion.\nWang, 26, faces up to seven years in jail on charges of counter-revolutionary incitement -- or subversion. A court in Beijing was expected to deliver a verdict on Wang\'s case as early as this week, said one source.\nWang, who is believed to have worked with Liu on several daring petitions, was detained in May 1995 in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the June 1989 military crackdown.\nA former student of Beijing University, Wang served four years in jail for counter-revolutionary activities for his role as a leader of the 1989 demonstrations.\nHe had been expected to face charges since the court that sentenced veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng last December to 14 years for plotting to overthrow the government also implicated Wang in its verdict.\nLiu and Wang are among a very few dissidents who are not serving jail terms or re-education through labour penalties.\nA court in central Henan province last month sentenced student leader-turned-dissident Guo Haifeng to seven years in prison for hooliganism. Police had initially accused Guo of fraud but the prosecutor did not file charges against him, a human rights group said.\n'

a(S'One of China\'s most prominent dissidents, Wang Dan, is expected to receive a harsh sentence on the charge of plotting to overthrow the government, his mother said on Tuesday.\nWang, 27, would plead not guilty to the capital charge when his trial at the Beijing Intermediate People\'s Court begins on Wednesday, said the dissident\'s mother, Wang Lingyun.\n"The court...giving my son a harsh sentence even though he is innocent is very likely to happen," Wang Lingyun told Reuters. "I dare not rule it out."\nShe said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.\nThe former student leader, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.\nThe court has refused to give details of Wang\'s trial except to say he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nHis family found a lawyer willing to defend the dissident after being given just one day in which to do so.\nWang\'s mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.\nThe mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated during his detention.\nHuman Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership\'s increasing intolerance of dissent.\n"The fact is that China\'s urban dissident movement... has in effect been comprehensively smashed," it said in a statement.\n"At least where political dissidents are concerned, all the judicial signs thus far point... to intensified repression by the country\'s state security forces," it said, calling for a freeze on trade missions from the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.\nThe human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers were generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.\nWang\'s court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year\'s trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China\'s tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nOfficials have been silent on a request by the U.S. embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang\'s trial, diplomats said.\nFrench senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang\'s trial.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang\'s trial was China\'s internal affair.\nBeijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China\'s internal affairs is not welcome.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.\n'

a(S'China hopes for a breakthrough to launch manned space flights early next century and planns to land a spacecraft on the moon in the 21st century, the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.\nSenior Chinese space officials had unveiled an ambitious, multi-million dollar and wide-ranging programme that was aimed at giving the country a competitive edge in international space development, Xinhua said, quoting senior officials.\nChina is known to be eager to push ahead with its space programme to expand its role in the commercial satellite business while winning international prestige through trumpeting its technological advances, industry analysts have said.\nManned space flights were being given top priority in China\'s space programme, which includes building a heavy solar satellite in partnership with Germany as well as developing a new generation of lightweight spacecraft to \'bus\' satellites into orbit, Xinhua said.\n"The country is expected to make a breakthrough in manned space technology at the beginning of the next century," Xinhua said, quoting Wang Liheng, vice-administrator of the China National Space Administration.\nWang gave no more details of the manned space flight programme, which has been rumoured for some time.\nHowever, Li Jianzhong, president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, told Xinhua that China was pushing ahead with its goal to boost launch vehicle technology in the 21st century. He said the goal was to build rockets that could carry 20-tonne payloads -- more than twice the current capacity of the nation\'s most powerful launch vehicles.\nChina, which put its first satellite into orbit in 1970, has been trying to expand its role in the commercial space market, despite a series of recent setbacks.\nIn August a Long March 3 rocket, considered one of China\'s most reliable launch vehicles, failed to put a U.S.-built satellite into orbit. In February, technical flaws had even more disastrous results when a new generation Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after take-off, killing six people.\nLi said China also planned to develop a reuseable space transport system and vehicle re-entry and landing systems.\nCheng Fangyun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said a small spacecraft with low operating costs would be designed.\n"China has reliable technology for space tracking, telemetry and control to do this," Xinhua quoted Cheng as saying.\nIn terms of moon exploration, China planned to provide cheap transport systems for lunar-landing spacecraft to explore the moon and developing lunar resources, Xinhua said.\nXu Fuxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology, said items under development included a scientific satellite, the Shijian-5, which was light and cheap and would become a \'bus\' for small satellites.\nIn solar observation, China and Germany were cooperating to produce a two-tonne lunar satellite equipped with a solar telescope. The $100 million satellite was expected to be sent into orbit around 2002, said CAS member Ai Guoxiang.\nChina has also decided to invest 170 million yuan to build the world\'s most advanced sky survey telescope that could observe at least 100 million galaxies, he said.\nChina was working on its own space station, Xinhua said.\nIt is cooperating with the United States and Russia to build a magnetic spectrograph aboard the Alfa station -- scheduled to be launched early next century -- that was expected to detect anti-matter and dark matter in the universe, Xinhua said.\n'

a(S'Top Hollywood film stars, including screen idols Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, have been placed on a blacklist of 50 people barred from visiting the restive region of Tibet, Chinese officials said on Friday.\nNews that some of Hollywood\'s biggest box office draws were on a blacklist comes just weeks after Beijing clashed with U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Co over its film on the life of Tibet\'s exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.\nBrad Pitt, Harrison Ford and his wife Melissa Mathison Ford as well as directors Martin Scorsese and Jean-Jaques Annaud were among a group of movie personalities on a blacklist held by the Tibet Tourism Bureau, a tourist official said by telephone from the regional capital, Lhasa.\n"Last October, we were verbally informed by the Tibet state security office that those foreigners should not be given an entry permit if they applied to visit Tibet," he said.\n"At the end of April or in early May, we received the formal documents," he said, when asked if the Hollywood stars were barred from the Himalayan region that has been rocked by sporadic anti-Chinese unrest in recent years.\n"They are banned from coming here for any reason," the official said, adding that none of those named on the list had yet applied to visit.\nBrad Pitt stars as an escaped Austrian prisoner of war, who fled India in World War Two and found refuge in Lhasa where he befriended the young Dalai Lama, in the film "Seven Years in Tibet" that is directed by Annaud. China has not formally objected to the film.\nHowever, it has apparently tried to halt production by California-based Walt Disney of the film "Kundun" that tells of the Dalai Lama\'s early life and is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie.\nDisney has said it will go ahead with the release of "Kundun" despite China\'s objections. Beijing has denied putting pressure on Disney to withdraw backing for the film.\nBeijing has been reported to have warned Walt Disney last month that its ambitious business plans in China were at risk if it went ahead with the release of the movie.\nA Foreign Ministry spokesman said Disney would be wrong to sing the praises of the exiled spiritual leader.\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and has since waged a non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.\nHowever, the blacklist did not include actor Richard Gere, who has long backed the Tibetan spiritual movement and is an active supporter of the Dalai Lama, the tourism official said.\nGere was among a group of movie luminaries who this month wrote to China\'s ambassador in Washington protesting against what they called Beijing\'s "attempt to impose worldwide censorship".\nOfficials had begun to compile a blacklist of foreigners barred from visiting the restive area in 1993, and the list had now reached more than 50 names, he said.\nAll foreign visitors to Tibet are required first to obtain an entry permit issued by local authorities who are anxious to keep out Westerners who may support the underground pro-independence movement spearheaded by the region\'s monks.\n'

a(S'Czech surgeons began exploratory surgery on President Vaclav Havel on Monday to remove a spot from his lung, but the former dissident playwright has said that his health was not in serious danger.\nHavel\'s office announced in a statement that a news briefing would be held on Monday afternoon after the operation but an official said it was impossible to say how the long the surgery would last.\nHavel, a heavy smoker who spent almost five years in communist jails, has been ill for several weeks.\nBut in his weekly radio address, broadcast on Sunday, he was in an optimistic mood, saying the operation would "remove some sort of bad point or spot found on my lungs, the character of which is still unknown".\n"However, even if it is something bad, it is so small and its location is so favourable that it seems that I am in no serious danger," he said in the address, recorded on Friday.\nHavel, who led the 1989 "Velvet Revolution" which overthrew communism, said in the address from his hospital bed: "I am here not because my state of health is worsening".\n"On the contrary, never in the past few weeks have I felt as well as I feel just now."\nHavel, who is widely respected at home and abroad, was admitted to hospital last Monday, more than a week after his office said he was suffering from pneumonia. Later surgeons described the planned surgery as "medium serious".\nThe Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that a sample of the spot would be sent for immediate analysis during the operation. Based on the results, surgeons would decide whether to continue with the operation, it said without elaborating.\nHavel will keep his full presidential responsibilities during the operation.\nUnder the Czech constitution, most executive power lies with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who is attending the European security summit in Lisbon in Havel\'s place.\nHavel\'s power lies more in his personal authority and reputation for honesty in a Czech political scene increasingly dominated by squabbling and allegations of impropriety.\nOpinion polls show his popularity rating at around 80 percent while public disillusionment with Czech politics is widespread.\nTurnout for elections to the new Senate last month was just 30 percent in the second round, and a poll published last week showed that 58 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the state of Czech politics.\nHavel, whose wife Olga died of cancer in January, supports the free market but has bitterly criticised the corruption, dishonesty and materialism which has accompanied the scramble to make money.\n'

a(S'The main Czech oil refiner, Ceska Rafinerska a.s., said on Wednesday it would reopen the hydrocracking unit at its Litvinov refinery, damaged by a fire last month, by the end of January.\nCompany spokesman Ales Soukup said that the fire on December 2, and another apparently unrelated fire eight days before that, would have some effect on 1996 earnings, but he said it was not yet clear to what extent.\n"The refinery is in full operation... the cracking unit was put aside. It should be reopen by the end of January," Soukup told Reuters.\nHe said that the refinery, in the northwest of the country, was processing crude at normal levels, but the depth of quality of the processing was lower due to the absence of the cracker.\n"(The fires) will certainly have some impact, on the other hand, the company is insured, so a number of those damages will be paid for," he said.\nSoukup added that final results for last year should be known at the end of the first quarter.\nThe fire affecting the hydrocrcker broke out on December 2 in a furnace of the unit, just as crude flow resumed after an eight-day stoppage.\nOil flow had been halted when a blaze ripped through a tanking terminal in another part of the refinery on November 23.\nThey were the first major reported incidents at the refinery since a western consortium took a major equity stake in the newly created Ceska Rafinerska at the end of 1995.\nIn a deal completed last year, the IOC consortium of three foreign oil groups bought a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska, a company set up to operate the two main Czech refineries at Litvinov and Kralupy, earlier belonging to Chemopetrol Group a.s. and Kaucuk Group a.s. .\nThe IOC is equally owned by DuPont Co unit Conoco of the United States, Royal Dutch/Shell , and Italy\'s Agip SpA .\nThe state holds the remaining 51 percent stake in Rafinerska through the holding company Unipetrol a.s..\nThe remaining parts of Kaucuk and Chemopetrol, both controlled by the state, are to complete a merger into Unipetrol with a share swap planned for later this year.\nUnlike recent January\'s, Czech refineries are recieving Russian crude supplies normally through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, which had frequent New Year\'s flow interruptions the past two years because of rows over transit fees between Moscow and Kiev.\n-- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n'

a(S'Hong Kong-based freight forwarding company U-Freight Holdings Limited is considering opening an office in Guangzhou to take advantage of China Southern Airlines\' growing international network, U-Freight managing director Anthony Fong said.\nUntil now, U-Freight\'s Chinese operations which started nine years ago have been concentrated in the north with freight forwarding operations in Beijing, Dalian and Shanghai, Fong said. U-Freight\'s new US$2 million, 4,200 square meter warehouse near Shanghai airport is on schedule for completion in December and Fong said he sees new potential just across the border from Hong Kong where the company was established 28 years ago.\n"If Guangzhou is to have foreign flights then eventually other foreign carriers will fly into Guangzhou. It should save the trouble of trucking cargo down from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and we are investigating opening an office there," Fong said.\nIndustry observers said Guangzhou-based China Southern has invested in a new fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft to begin transcontinental services to Europe and the west coast of the USA and U-Freight is among a group of many well known freight forwarders who are eyeing the potential new market. Recent Hong Kong press reports said China Southern is starting a Guangzhou-Beijing-Amsterdam service next month and planning additional services to Los Angeles and Brisbane next year. No one at China Southern could be contacted for confirmation.\n"We are just awaiting a start date for China Southern\'s new trans-Pacific flight," Fong told Reuters in an interview here.\nFong said the licensing procedure to start operations, especially to gain a Class one licence which allows freight forwarders to hold a stock of airway bills, will take time and patience.\n"A proper licence in Shanghai took three years to achieve so it is early days yet but we would like to go into Guangzhou and a first step would be to set up a liaison office in the near future," Fong added. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n'

a(S'All three airlines flying directly between Hong Kong and London said they can start to use a new, short cut to Europe across China from this weekend with the start of winter timetables on Sunbday October 27.\nThis means more cargo and less fuel can be carried along with a cut in passenger journey times of up to an hour, industry sources said.\nCathay Pacific Airways, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all say they can begin to utilise the new northern route over China instead of the traditional longer southerly route over Thailand and India in their winter schedules. The short cut was agreed during recent talks between the British and Chinese governments, they say.\nA Cathay Pacific spokesman said up to an hour can be cut off the flying time for its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on some European routes which will also have the ability to carry an additional four tonnes of cargo. BA can carry an extra 70 tonnes of air cargo a week if its twice weekly 747-400 aircraft utilise the new routing, its Hong Kong based spokesman said.\nA spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said the new routing will enable its Airbus A340 aircraft to carry an extra six tonnes of freight westbound and two tonnes eastbound and save around 50,000 pounds of fuel.\nAviation analysts say the new routing offers significant cost saving advantages and allows airlines to carry full cargo loads all year round because strong headwinds during the summer restricts cargo payload.\nBut they say it is not all good news because the airlines haven\'t been granted permission for all flights.\n"It is fantastic news for the airlines and very influential on the bottom line but realistically Cathay can\'t utilise the new routes on all flights because it has not been given a full quota and neither have the others," Peter Negline, Vice President and senior research analyst of Asia Pacific equity research at Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Limited told Reuters in an interview.\nA Cathay Pacific spokesman said it will have the most access to the number of flights that can use the new routing. Other European services to Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt will also be able to benefit as well as London bound ones, he added.\nCurfews at both Heathrow and Kai Tak airports will also cause scheduling difficulties until Hong Kong\'s new, around the clock airport at Chek Lap Kok is due to open in 18 months time, analysts say.\n"Aircraft need to leave Hong Kong before the 11.30 pm local (16.30 GMT) curfew starts but the new routing could mean arrival at Heathrow at round 04.30 GMT which is two hours before the end of their curfew so the new routing doesn\'t offer a lot there,"Negline said.\n"You can also see a further deterioration in cargo yields because the airlines are getting extra capacity for next to nothing," Negline added.\nNegline said the airlines will also benefit from better aircraft and crew utilisation; the aircraft will be able to fly extra sectors and its crew who fly for less hours can be redeployed on other services.\nDeclan Magee, a Hong Kong based airline analyst for regional stockbrokers and investment bankers HG Asia also said the new routing will obviously benefit aircraft utilisation and fuel efficiency.\n"Yes shorter routes will save money but if all three airlines are allowed to do the same thing that rules out competitive advantage. If only one airline could use the new route then it would be different but the consumer will feel the benefit.\nMagee said the Hong Kong to London route is Cathay\'s fourth largest passenger revenue generating route of around HK$1.4 billion a year.\n"It is a relatively important route but even if they can save four or five per cent on this route compared to Cathay\'s total turnover of around HK$30 billion a year.it\'s not that much. Yes, it\'s a useful way in which Cathay can offset some of the negatives it is facing in terms of yield decline," Magee said.\nAnalysts reckon the airlines can save around 10 tons of fuel per flight but that may be offset by expected higher overfly fees set by the Chinese who are aware of how much the airlines can save.\nAnalysts say the airlines need all the help they can get by utilising shorter routes and using new technology such as FANS - Future Air Navigation System which allows aircraft more direct routing. Because of successful negotiations earlier, Swissair and Lufthansa have been able to fly the shorter route over China to Europe for the past two years. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017\n'

(Reuter) China\'s flag carrier and largest airline, Air China is planning to restart flying to Los Angeles next year, Zhang Jinming, general director of the airline\'s advertising division said\nThe Beijing, Shanghai service would be "at least twice weekly" and use a Boeing 747-400 or Boeing 747 Combi aircraft, Zhang stated.\nLos Angeles used to be part of the network but was stopped some time ago. Speaking through an interpreter, Zhang said it would be Air China\'s third service to the USA after San Francisco and New York.\nZhang was speaking on the opening day of China\'s first official air show held at the showpiece Zhuhai airport about 35 miles across the Pearl River delta from Hong Kong. Another major Chinese airline, China Southern Airlines, also confirmed at the show that it too was planning to start a Los Angeles service in March of next year.\nZhang also said Air China was expecting to soon announce a new service from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to Sydney and Melbourne. He could give no further details.\nA recent New China News Agency report said Air China planned to open both the US west coast and Australian routes last month. No reason was given by Zhang for the apparent delay. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017\n'

a(S'Airbus Industrie is for the first time in Asia marketing cargo space aboard the world\'s largest civil transporter, the consortium\'s press relations manager in China, David Velupillai, told Reuters.\nSpeaking at China\'s first airshow being held here, he said the Airbus A300-600 Super Transporter fleet has 800 hours a year available for wet lease. Known as the Beluga because of its giant, whale like appearance and cavernous 7.4 metre high jaw-like door, it is one of the world\'s most unusual aircraft which Airbus said can carry more voluminous freight than any other.\nThe first two of an eventual fleet of four aircraft are being used to transport large sections of fuselage and the wings for the Airbus family which are made near Chester, England and are flown to Toulouse for assembly. Other fuselage sections weighing up to 45 tons and 30 metres long are transported from Spain and Germany.\nWhen the aircraft are not busy doing that, Airbus says it hope it can profit from wet leases of other outsize cargoes such as helicopters, aircraft engines and space satellites in which field China is a key world player with its Long March launcher.\n"No other aircraft in the world can carry such large and unusual loads. The thing about satellites is they need to be transported whole and cannot be broken down for transport. It is a niche market but one we think there are opportunities in," Velupillai said.\nAirbus said its large transporter has already been used to carry a satellite module which will form part of space station Alpha from Turin in Italy to Toulouse . Other projects include ferrying aviator Richard Branson\'s balloon to Morocco for his aborted round the world attempt.\nThe Beluga made its air show debut at Paris last year but is not being exhibited in China.\nThe twin engined purpose-built jets replace veteran four propellor engined Super Guppy aircraft which Airbus said are destined to become museum pieces. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017\n'

a(S'Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel on Monday announced a deal giving creditor banks 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out one billion pounds ($1.56 billion) of its debt mountain.\nThe long-awaited restructuring brings to an end months of wrangling between Eurotunnel and the 225 banks to which it owes nearly nine billion pounds.\nThe deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of insolvency but leaves shareholders owning only 54.5 percent of the company.\n"The restructuring plan provides Eurotunnel with the medium term financial stability to allow it to consolidate its substantial commercial achievements to date and to develop its operations," Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton said.\nThe firm was now making a profit before interest, he added.\nAlthough shareholders will see their interests diluted, they were offered the prospect of a brighter future after months of uncertainty while Eurotunnel wrestled to reduce crippling interest payments negotiated during the tunnel\'s construction.\nEurotunnel, which has taken around half the cross-Channel market from the European ferry companies, said a strong operating performance could allow it to pay its first dividend within the next 10 years.\nFrench co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said shareholders would have to be patient before they could reap the benefits of the company\'s success.\nHe called the debt restructuring plan "an acceptable compromise" for holders of Eurotunnel shares.\nThe company said in a statement there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the full 225 bank syndicate for approval, probably early in 1997.\nMonday\'s announcement followed two weeks of highly secretive negotiations between Eurotunnel and its six leading banks. This was extended to the 24 "instructing banks" at a meeting late last week in London.\nEurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share. That is considerably below the level of around 160 pence widely reported in the run up to the deal, and will reduce outstanding debt of 8.7 billion pounds by 1.0 billion.\nThe company said a further 3.7 billion pounds of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.\nIf they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders\' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.\nEurotunnel\'s shares, which were suspended last week at 113.5 pence ahead of Monday\'s announcement, should resume trading on Tuesday, the company said.

a(S'British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke on Tuesday took the expected step of phasing out tax relief on profit related pay (PRP) schemes.\nBut analysts were pleasantly surprised the proposal still allowed new schemes to be registered as the tax relief is reduced and were relieved the Chancellor did not abolish the arrangement in one go.\nClarke said there would be no change to the upper limit of pay that is free of income tax, currently 4,000 stg, in profit periods beginning before January 1 1998.  \nFor 1998 the ceiling will be reduced to 2,000 stg and 1,000 stg in 1999. No relief will be given for profit periods starting on or after January 1, 2000.\n"I\'m not surprised that the relief was not abolished in one go," said Bob Rothenburg of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. "It would have created a lot of pressure on employers to compensate employees."\nDouglas Fairbairn of Ernst and Young said he was relieved at the Chancellor\'s proposals, which could have included immediate abolition.  \nFor Fairbairn, the main surprise was that new schemes would be allowed at the lower rates of relief.\nThis was confirmed by the Inland Revenue, where a spokeswoman said if existing schemes were to be allowed to continue, it was only fair that companies wishing to introduce new schemes, even at the lower rates of relief, should be allowed to do so.\nFairbairn said the fact that new schemes were to be allowed, meant he doubted the government\'s estimate of the yield from the measure would be met.\nThe Inland Revenue said it expected the proposal to yield 100 million stg in 1997/98; 700 million stg in 1998/99; 1.7 billion stg in 1999/2000; and 3.1 billion stg in 2000/2001.\nTax experts contacted by Reuters said one other possibility for Clarke would have been to limit the relief on PRP to the standard rate of tax, which he reduced to 23 percent from 24 percent, rather than the marginal rate -- currently 40 percent.\nAfter a slow start following its introduction in 1987, there are now around 14,000 PRP schemes covering 3.7 million employees. Take-up of the schemes increased considerably after the tax relief was doubled in 1991.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n'

a(S'Lloyds Bank was fined 325,000 pounds ($550,000) Wednesday by a British investment industry watchdog and appears set to pay millions of pounds in compensation to disadvantaged customers.\nThe Investment Management Regulatory Organisation said it fined Lloyds, which merged with TSB last year to form Lloyds TSB Group Plc, for breaches of rules relating to its pensions transfer business between April 1988 and June 1993.\nLloyds agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought against it, the fifth such settlement IMRO has made with firms that have been found guilty of improper sales of pension products.\nIMRO said Lloyds "did not obtain or have systems to obtain all relevant facts about the personal and financial circumstances of its customers needed to advise them properly about pensions transfers."\nIt said Lloyds had not provided certain customers "with all the information needed to enable them to make a balanced and informed decision on whether to carry out a pension transfer."\nLloyds, which must pay IMRO\'s investigation costs of 63,000 pounds ($107,000) and make a contribution to its disciplinary costs, has already offered redress to some customers and the review of some 2,600 Lloyds transfer cases "is well advanced and will be substantially completed by Dec. 31, 1997," IMRO added.\nThe bank expressed its regret in a statement.\n"Lloyds Bank deeply regrets the errors which have resulted in charges being brought against it by IMRO for its pension transfer business," it said.\nAs a group, Lloyds TSB has made provisions totalling 165 million pounds ($279 million) for possible compensation payments to do with the mis-selling of pension products.\nThese relate to the Lloyds Bank business as well as the pensions activities of TSB before the merger, and of Lloyds\' insurance subsidiary Lloyds Abbey Life.\nThe pension scandal, whereby individuals transferred their pensions and were disadvantaged as a result, has been one of the most serious faced by the British financial services industry in recent years.\nThe affair knocked a big hole in the public\'s confidence in the industry and companies are set to pay a price running into hundreds of million of pounds as a result.\nIn November, Britain\'s top financial markets regulator the Securities and Investments Board announced a new strategy to try and clear a logjam in the pensions industry\'s review of the selling of pension products and the payment of compensation to investors.\nBoth regulators and insurance and investment companies have come under a barrage of criticism over the length of time it has taken to complete a review of cases.\nLloyds said it has identified some 2,600 pension transfer customers of which it anticipates having to pay compensation to around 1,500.\n'

a(S'Britain\'s largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society, said Friday its planned initial public offering in June could be worth as much as 12 billion pounds ($20 billion).\nUnveiling a price range and details of share allocations to the society\'s members, Halifax Chief Executive Mike Blackburn said it "will represent the largest single extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK."\nThe mutually-owned Halifax, with assets of over 100 billion pounds ($167.8 million), said flotation adviser Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had estimated a share price of between 390 and 450 pence ($6.54 to $7.55) per share if the IPO had taken place on Dec. 16.\nThis equals a market worth of between 10.4 billion ($17.5 billion) and 12 billion pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market, former mortgage banker Abbey National Plc.\n"The valuation of 12 billion (pounds) is right in line with our expectations," said Peter Toeman, banking analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.\nOther analysts agreed and many expect the price on flotation day to be higher, saying that Friday\'s figures looked a little conservative.\nThe Halifax said each qualifying member will receive a basic allocation of 200 shares in a flotation of 2.675 billion shares.\nThe Halifax has 6.7 million investing members and two million borrowing members. Of these, there is an overlap 700,000, which means that the Society is sending out a total of around 8.0 million voting packs.\nInvesting members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particular dates. This will range from 200 shares to a maximum of 1,181 for those with 50,000 pounds ($84,430) or more.\nAt its special general meeting on Feb. 24, over 50 percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal or it will fail. The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote.\nThe Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey\'s position as Britain\'s fifth-largest publicly-owned bank.\nIt said it sees room for huge expansion in the British insurance and long-term savings sectors.\n"We\'ll focus on the UK personal financial services sector," Halifax spokesman Davis Gilchrist said. "That\'s a very wide area, both on the borrowing side and, increasingly, on the savings side -- traditional savings and long-term savings."\n'

a(S"A bumper crop of results from the six major British banks which start their reporting season next week should take aggregate pre-tax profit comfortably above 12 billion stg for 1996 from just over 10.8 billion stg in 1995.\nAnalysts also expect some of them to return surplus capital to shareholders, either in the form of share buybacks or generous dividend payments.\nLeading the way on February 14 will be Lloyds TSB Group which, despite trading at a big premium to the sector, is still favoured by analysts because of its business mix.  \nThe bank's new chief executive Peter Ellwood is expected to give voice to his plans for the group as he takes over from Sir Brian Pitman.\nLloyds is expected to weigh in with over 2.4 billion stg in pretax profit and dividend per share of about 13p, accompanied by the highest return on equity at around 32 percent.\nNext on the agenda will be Barclays on February 18, when many analysts are expecting another chapter in its series of share buybacks. The bank has already spent over 1.0 billion stg on these in the last 18 months.  \nProfits are expected to rise to a consensus expectation of around 2.39 billion stg compared to 2.08 billion in 1995.\nBarclays is expected to show strong growth in businesses like Barclaycard and consumer lending but its investment banking unit BZW, which has had a year of upheavals, could disappoint.\nBarclays will be followed by the very different Standard Chartered, the London-based bank with a strong Far East franchise.\nSome analysts have cut their earnings estimates slightly but StanChart's pretax profit is still seen rising to around 870 million stg from 661 million last time.  \nGrowth in consumer banking in Asia will be tempered by the decline in the dollar, a possible small upturn in costs and the sale of its profitable private banking unit last year.\nA dividend of 14 or 15p per share is seen after 11p in 1995.\nHSBC Holdings, the other London-based bank with huge Far East interests and the most profitable bank in the group, reports on March 3.\nHSBC, which brings together Britain's Midland Bank, Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng Bank, and Marine Midland in the U.S., is expected to post pretax profits of some 4.6 billion stg after 3.67 billion in 1995.  \nDividend per share is seen rising to around 40p from 32p the previous year.\nHSBC is also expected to have been affected by the recent strength of sterling but will show profit gains in all its regions and units, with analysts bullish for the potential still to be unlocked in Asia.\nNational Westminster Bank, unlike HSBC, has a much stronger focus on investment banking and has spent a lot of money building up its NatWest Markets unit with several acquisitions and other investment.  \nThis has led to nervousness among investors and the shares underperformed the rest of the sector last year.\nNatWest reports on February 25 and is expected to post pretax profits of 1.1 to 1.2 billion stg -- after disposal losses and exceptional asset write-downs -- and a full year dividend of 29p.\nMany analysts also expect a further repurchase of shares.  \nFinally, Abbey National, in the news currently because of its bid for mutual life assurance firm Scottish Amicable, reports on February 27 and is expected to show pretax profits of around 1.15 to 1.16 billion stg (after 1.03 billion in 1995) and a dividend of around 26p compared to 21.75p.\nThe Abbey's capital position has led to talk of a share buyback but the management is against this because of the large number of small shareholders on the register.\nA special dividend could be on the cards but most analysts expect the Abbey to continue its relatively generous ordinary dividend policy.  \nThe figures are likely to have been helped by some growth in the mortgage market and by a good rise in consumer lending. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.\n"

a(S'Italy, seeking a larger role in helping to fold former East Bloc countries into NATO, believes it is better to integrate, and not isolate, fringe candidates like Slovakia and Romania, a senior Italian diplomat said.\nDuring an official visit to Prague, Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Piero Fassino told reporters late on Wednesday that Italy, as part of its new focus he called "Italian Ostpolitik", saw four countries as primary candidates for NATO\'s expansion.\n"The position of Italy...is that the group of countries which definitely belong to NATO is Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia," he said, but added: "There\'s also a possiblity that Slovakia and Romania belong to that group."\nHe said it was important for Slovakia and Romania to implement agreements with Hungary aimed mainly at protecting the rights of ethnic Hungarians living in both countries.\nFassio said that before the West says "no" to Slovakia and Romania it was necessary to determine carefully whether they meet NATO\'s standards of democracy, but he added:\n"If a country is integrated then we also have the right to require it to meet standards of the organisation it has joined.\n"If it\'s isolated we can\'t demand anything," he said.\nBoth the EU and the United States have repeatedly lambasted Slovakia\'s government for slow democratic reforms and adopting laws threating to political opponents and ethnic minorities saying they might delay membership into "Western structures".\nFassio said it would be more useful to put fringe countries like Slovakia into the fold where more pressure can be applied.\n"It is true that Slovakia is having problems fulfilling democratic principles, but the question is, \'Do we isolate Slovakia or integrate Slovakia?\'. I believe it is more useful to integrate it," he said. REUTER\n'

a(S'Elections to the new Czech Senate over the next two weekends will only thicken the country\'s political fog, but an indecisive electorate has already been priced into the financial markets, analysts said on Monday.\nPrime Minister Vaclav Klaus has been stuck in an uneasy political co-habitation since his centre-right coalition fell two seats short of a majority in the lower house on a strong second place showing by the Social Democrats in June.\nAnalysts say the Senate elections should not signal any clear shift in the political winds, and the markets will be stuck wondering if the three-party conservative government can hang on for its four-year term which runs through the year 2000.\nThey say only an unexpected clear victory for the opposition Social Democrats over Klaus\'s Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would hurt the Czech crown or capital markets.\n"The markets will definitely turn down (on a Social Democrat victory), same as in the (lower house) elections," said Vladimir Jaros, research director at Prague investment house Wood &amp; Co.\nBut he added that market expectations "are for ODS to win".\nKlaus and his team of economists and technocrats became standard-bearers for post-Communist reforms after taking power in 1992 with a 12-seat majority in the lower house.\nThe markets, pollsters and pundits were caught off guard when the Social Democrats -- who have been ambivalent to balanced budgets and privatisations -- did so well.\nThe crown fell a full percentage point on the June results, and the stock market lost more than four percent of its value before stabilising when a minority government was confirmed.\n"I think investors (this time) have already included in their behaviour expectations of inconclusive results," said Zdenek Bakala, chairman of Prague-based Patria Finance.\nODS and the Social Democrats are running close in recent opinion polls at around 25 percent support each, after ODS won the June vote with 29.6 percent, with CSSD at 26.4 percent.\nBut since the Senate vote is a first-past-the-post poll in individual constituencies, forecasting victory is difficult when gauged only by available party preference surveys.\nLocal analysts see Klaus\'s ODS and its two coalition allies winning a majority of the Senate\'s 81 seats, but they do not expect a result giving the coalition or opposition a clear advantage to push for an early election in the lower house.\n"I don\'t think we are going to be facing a risk of extraordinary (lower house) elections, and I doubt that ODS will be willing to take that risk," Jaros said.\nThe two-round Senate polls, beginning on Friday with runoffs the next weekend, are not likely alter the course of the country\'s legislative agenda.\nThe stock market and the Czech crown have had diverging fates since the June vote, for reasons beyond election fears.\nThe crown has remained strong, despite a growing trade gap, consistently trading in a tight range between 2.5 to 3.0 percent above the central bank\'s mark/dollar basket.\nThe crown got a boost in October when four Social Democrats crossed over to vote with the government in approving the first draft of the 1997 budget.\nMeanwhile, the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) has been rocked, not by the political situation, but by discontent from foreign investors unhappy with the country\'s opaque trading environment.\nThe PSE\'s official PX50 index has been on a steady slide since late summer, dipping below 500 last week, heading toward its historic record low of 387.\nFew think the Senate elections will serve to revive the securities markets, as market reform is not a high priority.\n'

a(S'A stronger showing by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus\'s centre-right Civic Democratic Party in the first round of Senate elections may give a mild fillip to local financial markets, Czech analysts predicted.\nBut a thin turnout made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters\' hearts, the analysts said.\n"Nobody can jump to conclusions based on these figures, because if you take the total turnout, it\'s nothing," said Radek Maly, economist at Citibank Prague.\n"We might see a mild strengthening of the crown, but we don\'t think any major movement," he added.\nThe currency has traded in a tight range recently at around 26.9 to the dollar and 17.8 to the mark or roughly 2.5 percent above parity with the central bank\'s mark/dollar basket.\nBut Maly stressed that the market was focused on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences.\nKlaus\'s Civic Democratic Party won 36 percent of the nationwide vote on Saturday.\nThe centre-left opposition Social Democrats were second with 20 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists. Only 35 percent of the electorate voted.\nOf the 81 Senate seats, Civic Democrats won three outright in the first round and 73 of their candidates go into next weekend\'s runoff as the top vote getter in their district.\nThe Civic Democrats took less that 30 percent of the vote in June\'s general elections, costing the coalition its majority in the lower house.\nMiroslav Nosal, equities analyst at Prague investment house Patria Finance, said that a premature general election was probably not on the cards, and said the stock market had other concerns than party politics.\n"Poor regulation and transparency is already included in the share prices, but from a fundamental point of view many stocks are quite attractive," said Nosal,\nHe said some foreign investors might be tempted to play on Klaus\'s victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.\n-- Prague newsroom  (42 2) 24 23 0003\n'

a(S'Austin Reed Group Plc supplier of pinstriped suits to generations of British businessmen, said on Wednesday that a return to favour with women executives helped to boost its first-half profits and sales.\nThe group, which has around 50 stores in the UK and sells its classic-cut styles in Europe, Japan and the U.S., saw first half profits jump 64 percent to 2.3 million pounds ($3.6 million) while sales climbed 7.0 percent to 38.9 million pounds.\nNew chief executive Chris Thomson said in an interview that a turnaround in womens\' clothing, which now accounts for around 20 percent of sales, was a key factor behind the gains.\nHe said the 1995 spring collection for women had been a "bit of disaster," when Austin Reed\'s ranges "didn\'t sell and we had to substantially discount to get rid of stock, so we are delighted by the way it\'s come back so successfully."\nAustin Reed, which began life in 1900 as a gentlemen\'s outfitters in Fenchurch Street in the heart of the City, said there are encouraging signs of a rise in UK consumer activity.\n"We are trading in a very competitive market," Thomson said, but he added that the group\'s autumn sales are ahead by around nine percent so far from a year ago.\nThe company plans to step up sales of its branded clothing through German, French and Italian retailers in particular.\n"The Austin Reed brand is well known in Europe, being a quintessentially British brand, and I think there are tremendous opportunities to expand that," Thomson said.\nIt is also looking to expand its UK retail chain, with new outlets in the heart of London\'s financial district, a new shopping centre in Dartford and the upmarket Manchester dormitory town of Wilmslow all in its sights.

a(S'Shares in perennial bid favourite Zeneca Group Plc spiralled higher once more on Thursday, but analysts said it was on the thinnest of pretexts.\nThe stock touched a new record of 17.25 pounds during the morning session, with the rise once more triggered by speculation about the intentions of Swiss drugs giant Roche Holding AG. -- hotly tipped by takeover theorists as the only company rich enough to buy Zeneca.\nNews that Roche had named Franz Humer as chief operating officer combined with talk in the press that Humer is keen to ensure Roche does "not play second fiddle" to his old employer Glaxo Wellcome fuelled the latest rise, traders said.\nWith few people willing to sell Zeneca stock in case they miss out on any takeover, which could be worth $30 billion, the stock is being continually squeezed higher.\nSociete Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST) analyst Peter Laing said Zeneca shares, which have gained 37 percent this year, are now at "eye-popping" levels. SGST believes that a hostile bid is implausible at current valuations, and, without this, the stock\'s current rating is increasingly hard to justify.\n"Is it valid for a stock which is only two-thirds a drug stock and the rest agro-chemicals and specialty chemicals to be on the same premium as Pfizer?" said Laing, who argued that the current gains are a story of "supply and demand."\nCash-rich Roche is widely believed to want to make a large acquisition, both to reassert its position as number one in Switzerland and to counteract the shortfall in new drugs coming through the industry\'s pipeline.\nBut some analysts and industry executives believe that Zeneca would not necessarily be its chosen target.\nOne industry source said he believed Roche would be much more interested in the U.S. company Schering-Plough Corp, which had a similar market capitalization to Zeneca. He said Roche had eyed Schering Plough on a number of occasions.\nSchering-Plough would offer Roche a much stronger footing in the key U.S. market than Zeneca, and it would plug gaps in Roche\'s existing infrastrucure, offering the Swiss group badly-needed muscle in the non-hospital and U.S. over-the-counter sectors.\nHowever, analysts said Zeneca had a more attractive pipeline of new drugs than Schering-Plough. And as the world\'s second-biggest cancer drug company after Bristol Myers Squibb Co it would also boost Roche in a key therapeutic area.\n"I am quite sure that at the right price several companies would like to acquire Zeneca," said Panmure Gordon analyst Robin Gilbert, adding that good quality medium-to-large businesses like Zeneca and Schering-Plough are few and far between.\nBut Gilbert said Zeneca, which is "firing on all cylinders" since its split from chemicals group ICI Plc in 1993, is determined to remain independent.\n"They believe they have a future as an independent company, and obviously they don\'t agree with the size philosphy of people like Glaxo Wellcome," Gilbert said.\n'

a(S'New evidence about British Biotech Plc\'s anti-cancer treatment Marimastat next week will provide important clues about its potential as a blockbuster product, analysts said on Friday.\nBritish Biotech is using a meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncologists (ESMO) in Vienna to make five presentations, including Marimastat\'s effects in ovarian, colo-rectal, pancreatic and gastric cancer. It will issue a general update on Monday morning.\nThe Oxford-based group has become the bellwether for the increasingly crowded biotech field in the U.K, with sentiment towards Marimastat having a disproportionate impact on the sector.\nMillions of pounds of investors\' money has been placed on the bet that Marimastat will turn out to be Europe\'s first big-selling biotech product, with forecasts for annual sales ranging from a few hundred million dollars to up to $4 billion.\nMonday\'s data comes from patients who continued to use the drug beyond the period necessary for completion of Phase II clinical trials. The company said this meant there would be a further six months of extra information.\nYamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said he hoped to see the first hard evidence that patients were living longer as a result of taking Marimastat. Refsum said the surrogate marker data provided so far "is like the indicator board at the train station rather than the train actually coming."\nIn a note on the trials Lehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith, who will attend the ESCO meeting, said it might be possible to glean indications of the effect of Marimastat on patient survival in ovarian and pancreatic cancer.\nThere will also be interest in Marimastat\'s impact on gastric cancer, where little information has so far been available. And analysts are keen to see how serious the side effects caused by the drug are. The main problem reported so far is joint pain.\nYamaichi\'s Refsum said the results are "not definitive as to whether it works or not, but it is another indication as to whether it will sell or won\'t sell, and that is the bottom line." Lehman\'s Smith added that the results "won\'t prove Marimastat\'s efficacy but will raise the probabilities."\nBritish Biotech will announce late-stage data on another key product, pancreatitis drug Lexipafant, on November 27.\nSmith said that favourable news on both drugs could lift the group\'s share price to 300 pence by the end of the month from 230 at Friday\'s close. But Refsum is more sceptical about the potential impact of Marimastat and said 150 pence is "reasonable value" for the shares.\nA British Biotech spokeswoman said Phase III Marimastat trials are likely to take two years to complete, meaning that the first results would not be available until 1998 at the earliest. But she said British Biotech would probably make academic presentations at conferences like ESMO from time to time to keep the market up to date.\nLate stage trials on pancreatic cancer started in June, and trials in small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and a form of brain cancer are being set up, she added.\n'

a(S'British Biotech Plc published further evidence on Monday that its cancer drug Marimastat worked, but analysts said there was still a long way to go before its potential as a blockbuster product can be confirmed.\nShares in the company slipped back after its keenly-awaited announcement appeared to provide comfort for both bulls and bears on Marimastat, a new class of cancer drug which some predict could one day have sales of $4 billion a year.\nThe stock was down 14 1/2 pence at 217 pence in early afternoon trading. But analysts noted that it rose sharply last week ahead of publication, while the decision by Morgan Grenfell to sell a sizeable chunk of its holding on October 29 had mopped up much of the buying interest in advance.\nOxford-based British Biotech used a cancer conference in Vienna to make a number of presentations on trials of the drug in gastric, colo-rectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer.\nIt said the studies, based on cancer patients who continued taking the drug after the 28-day period needed for Phase II trials, confirmed Marimastat\'s ability to reduce the rate of rise of cancer antigens, one measure of how much cancer is present in the body. It also provided evidence of succcess in gastric cancer, where a large scale trial is now underway.\nSome analysts said there was little new in the statement, which was largely a confirmation of Phase II, or intermediate stage, data published in May.\n"Those who were sceptical in May will remain sceptical and those who were bullish in May will remain bullish," said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nFinance director James Noble said the company had been deliberately cautious in its comments to avoid raising false hopes among cancer sufferers. Nevertheless he told Reuters that "In many ways I think this is the most impressive data since the company was floated.\nOne of the bulls, Greig Middleton analyst John Savin, said the real news was hidden in presentations made by doctors at the Vienna conference. He said that despite the "mishmash" of data from the trials, which covered 381 patients, there was "very compelling" evidence that Marimastat had improved chances of survival.\n"On this information today we can say that...37 percent (of patients) had a real overall response which improved their survival chance significantly," Savin said.\nHowever, others expressed disappointment that British Biotech failed to provide more detailed analysis of side effects caused by Marimastat. British Bitoech confirmed that it caused joint pain, mainly in the arm and shoulder, with around 30 percent of patients affected after three to five months.\nYamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said the side effect profile will be crucial to Marimastat\'s potential. "Drugs become top sellers because of their side effect profile rather than because of their efficacy profile," he said.\nNoble played down concerns about side effects, saying "they are not a serious problem. They are reversible." He said patients who suffer badly will be able to interrupt their treatment from time to time without any adverse impact.\nAnalysts pointed out that no real estimate of just how big Marimastat will be could be made until Phase III trials were completed. This means investors will have to wait until 1998 at the very earliest for hard evidence that their optimism about Marimastat and British Biotech is well founded.\n-- London Newsroom +44 71 542 7717\n'

a(S'Milumil babymilk powder, used by around 25,000 mothers in Britain and Ireland, was withdrawn from from stores and clinics on Friday after a scare over Salmonella poisoning.\nMilupa, part of the Dutch specialist food producer Nutricia NV, said it was withdrawing its Milumil milk powder in Britain because of an unconfirmed link with 12 cases of a rare form of the Salmonella bug.\nThe company later followed suit in Ireland after consultations with the Irish government, despite saying that no incidents had been reported there.\nThe company was forced to launch a damage limitation exercise after it was contacted by Britain\'s Department of Health on Thursday afternoon.\nGovernment scientists had identified 12 cases of Salmonella anatum infection, leading to gastro-enteritis, in children under 12 months old which followed consumption of the French-made milk, sold as "Milumil for Hungrier Bottle Fed Babies."\nThe Health Department said that only two of the children involved were admitted to hospital and all had since recovered. However it told parents and other carers to stop using the product immediately and ordered the withdrawal of all stocks.\n"There is no direct, incontrovertible proof that (the cause) is Milumil. It is a statistical association but we have to take every precaution," a company spokeswoman told Reuters.\nShares in Nutricia were suspended for around an hour in Amsterdam after falling sharply. However they later recovered much of their losses, closing down 9.70 guilders at 267, above a low of 260.50 guilders.\nMilupa said it would hold a thorough investigation at the French plant where the milk was made, and added that production of the product had been suspended.\nSales of Milumil milk powder total between six and seven million pounds a year, and the product has a market share of around five percent. Another Milumil product, Milumil Ready to Feed, is not affected.\nDutch-based Nutricia, which also owns the Cow &amp; Gate brand, is no stranger to controversy.\nIn June 1993, it withdrew all of its powdered baby food products in the United States because of possible Salmonella contamination.\nAnd 140 million guilders were wiped off the value of the company in November of the same year after it recalled batches of its Olvarit baby food when excessive levels of disinfectant were found in some samples.\n'

a(S'British utilities could find share buybacks and takeovers more costly as the government ruled out tax credits on buybacks and some special dividends on Tuesday, analysts said, but they are unlikely to stop such moves.\n"It should not stop companies doing buybacks or special dividends," said Michael Cohen, utilities analyst at Salomon Brothers, "those should still go ahead if justified."\nChancellor Kenneth Clarke said shareholders would no longer be able to claim tax credits on share buybacks or special dividends associated with share consolidations or takeovers.  \nThe move is a means of giving the UK Treasury more room for a cut in income tax in its November budget, analysts said.\nShares in the utility sector, which has seen a steady flow of buybacks and special dividends both within and outside the context of takeovers, initially slumped on the news but later showed some recovery.\n"It was a knee-jerk reaction, slightly overdone," said Kevin Lapwood, utilities analyst at Merrill Lynch.  \nShares in Anglian Water slid 31-1/2 to a low of 525 pence before edging back to 544-1/2 pence at 1300 GMT while Yorkshire Water was down 17-1/2 pence at 622-1/2 pence after slumping to a low of 613 pence.\nIn the electricity sector, London Electric stumbled to a low of 598 pence before recovering to be down 20-1/2 pence at 608-1/2 pence while generator PowerGen was off 10-1/2 pence at 479 pence from a low of 460 pence earlier.\n"The market was of the view that release of value from the balance sheets was less likely, but I think that was overdone," Lapwood said.  \nWater and electricity companies report half-year results in a flood between November and December and several had been tipped as likely to offer a buyback or special dividend.\nAnalysts said the upshot of the government\'s decision would be to make buybacks more expensive, but the impetus for such moves will not change.\n"The logic of a buyback has not changed, it will just be at a premium. And the move on special dividends could make takeovers more expensive, but if it is a good acquisition, it will go ahead," said one analyst who asked not to be identified.  \nCompanies are generally reticent about specific plans and several contacted declined to comment on the new tax rules or share strategies.\nAnalysts suggested that of the water companies, Yorkshire Water might consider a buyback while Anglian and Thames might consider restructuring the balance sheet.\nEast Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire Electricity and London Electric were singled out as potentially considering special dividends, while the market is still waiting to see such a move from PowerGen, analysts said.\n"It does not really affect the companies, just a group of investors," Cohen said.\nThose funds affected by the move are likely to change investments to try to avoid any impact, analysts said.\n"At the end of the day it will probably end up roughly equal," the analyst said.\n"Gross funds will restructure and companies will come out with cleverer mechanisms," he added.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n'

a(S'Privatised nuclear power generator British Energy Plc sparked criticism on Wednesday when it announced job cuts that failed to impress the stock market and angered unions.\n"I don\'t think this move transforms (British Energy\'s) prospects at all," said Philip Hollobone, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe.\nBritish Energy said in a statement it aimed to cut 1,460 jobs in Scotland and Wales to make savings in staff costs of 50 million pounds ($78 million) within three years.\nIt said it would have a one-off restructuring charge of 100 million pounds which was already provided for.\nChief executive Robert Hawley said there could be more savings to come as cuts in office costs came through.\nUnion representatives slammed the move in a statement as "a high risk strategy," warning that job cuts could "reduce training, lower standards and threaten safety."\nThe Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), part of Britain\'s Health and Safety Executive, said it would review the plans and take action if it felt safety would suffer.\n"If we think (the plans) are adverse (for safety), we will use regulatory powers to stop (British Energy) doing them," a spokesman for the NII said.\nBut Hawley maintained that "safety is our bottom line, not profit."\nBritish Energy\'s debut on the stock exchange in July was overshadowed by temporary closures of two of its eight reactors after cracks were discovered.\nShares kicked off below the partly-paid issue price of 105 pence to institutions and 100 pence to small investors and have rarely moved above those levels, mangaging just a half penny rise on the day on Wednesday to stand at 108 pence at 1130 GMT.\nThe ruling Conservative government pressed ahead with its privatisation despite the deep unpopularity of the deal and has been left with a stake of around 12 percent.\nThe opposition Labour Party also criticised the job cuts, which energy and industry spokesman John Battle said showed British Energy "has not performed as they promised they would."\nHe called on the company to confirm its dividend policy which it has said is vulnerable to underperformance by nuclear power stations.\nAlthough Hawley maintained the company\'s plans were aimed at making "absolutely sure we are competitive in the market place," analysts expressed concern it faced stiff challenges and remained an unattractive investment.\n"They are under pressure," said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST).\nWhiting said the crucial factor for British Energy was price of electricity in the so-called "pool," or wholesale market.\n"Pressure on electricity prices is downward in the medium to long term. (British Energy) has to address operating costs to get profits to stand still," he said.\nHollobone said the cost cuts should make predictions for dividend growth more secure but added that these were still below market averages.\n"Dividend growth is one of the lowest in the sector and there is no sign of a special dividend," he said.\nBritish Energy said at its privatisation that the first interim dividend would be 4.6 pence a share and forecasts for final dividend are for 9.1 pence in 1996/97.\n"You can get better value elsewhere. Why invest in British Energy?" Hollobone said. ($1=.6393 Pound)\n'

a(S'Electricity stocks crackled higher on Friday as rumours swirled around the market of a U.S. buyer for one of five remaining regional utilities and analysts said the forthcoming results season could provide a spur for action.\n"There is going to be a big focus on the ability of these companies to hand out more cash...if the results season is not going to get it going, then nothing will," said Chris Perry, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.\nElectricity sector companies kick off their half year results season towards the end of November.\nLeading the sector higher on Friday was East Midlands Electricity, after a report in the Daily Mail newspaper that a bid might emerge from Houston Industries of the United States at around 750 pence a share.\nHouston, tipped to buy one of the five remaining regional electricity companies (Recs) earlier this year, had been thought to have given up on the idea in August when it bought U.S. gas utility NorAm Energy for $3.8 billion.\nEast Midlands shot up to a high of 565 pence but eased back to close at 562, up 44 pence.\n"At the time of its last results, the company effectively indicated its surprise that it hadn\'t been taken over. Their shares had fallen back a long way and perhaps it\'s no surprise that bid rumours are re-emerging," Perry said.\nOther power utilities which remain independent also climbed, with Yorkshire Electricity up 28 pence to 742 pence and Southern Electric adding 13.5 pence to 631 pence.\nNorthern Electric, which survived a takeover bid from Trafalgar House last year, was up 29 pence to 523 pence and London Electricity, which supplies the capital with power, jumped 18.5 pence to 585 pence.\n"East Midlands is the one most likely to face a bid, it is smaller than others and more purely a distribution company," Nigel Hawkins at brokers Yamaichi said.\nA report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper also suggested that U.S. utility Duke Power might be circling the sector but no comment was available from either U.S. company.\nAnalysts said U.S. companies might not be the only ones interested in the sector, which has seen seven of the 12 Recs created at privatisation in 1990 fall prey to takeover bids.\nThe domestic supply business is to be opened to competition in 1998 and a range of companies from oil producers to supermarkets have already indicated an interest.\nOther potential interest could come from water companies, analysts said, especially following Britain\'s decision on Friday to block planned bids for South West Water from Severn Trent and Wessex Water.\n"You\'ve got two disappointed companies there," said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.\nAnalysts said Severn Trent could decide to use its resources to make a share buyback or a special dividend payout.\nBut Wessex Water may be enticed to link up with Southern Electric, analysts said, as multi-utilities have been approved.\nWelsh Water took over Swalec to form Hyder while United Utilities combined North West Water and Norweb.\n"The idea of multi-utilities is gaining ground," Whiting said.\n'

Sainsbury Plc rose on Wednesday after the group held out hope of an improved performance despite a fall in half year profits and sluggish sales.\n"The share price rise is a triumph of hope over statistics," said one sector analyst.\nSainsbury, which last year was overtaken as market leader by arch-rival Tesco, said half year pre-tax profits slipped, as analysts expected, to 393 million pounds ($637.4 million) from 456 million pounds in the same period last year.\nSainsbury also announced a dividend of 3.5 pence per share, up from 3.4 pence.\nThe company suffered its first fall in full year profits in 22 years when it reported in May. Pre-tax earnings before exceptional items fell 5.5 percent to 764 million pounds in the business year to March 9, 1996.\nAfter Wednesday\'s results, several analysts cut forecasts for the current full year to 710-725 million pounds, a level some analysts were already predicting, market sources said.\nBut shares closed up 8.5 pence to 363.5 pence, in a market which was generally easier after an unexpected quarter-point rise in British interest rates.\nThe group said current sales from comparable stores, excluding petrol, were rising in line with inflation of around three percent, well below the 7.5-percent gain reported by Tesco in September.\nA sector analyst who asked not to be named said "Sales moving in line with inflation is pretty disappointing, considering they\'ve introduced the loyalty card."\nThe Reward card is now accounting for much of the increase in sales Sainsbury is currently seeing.\n"Clearly, we want to do better (than three percent)", chairman David Sainsbury told Reuters. "This year will be about getting the basics right, next year will be about getting profits moving."\nThe company said marketing and operations initiatives along with the Reward card should continue to help boost sales and provide a strong Christmas season.\n"We will be fighting on our traditional ground of quality and choice, along with customer loyalty," Sainsbury said.\nSainsbury, which last week announced plans to launch a bank with Bank of Scotland, said there would be another "major development" on Reward soon and that it would move to strengthen its leadership in quality and choice.\nThe group also said Dino Adriano, currently deputy chief executive of the supermarket business, will take over from Tom Vyner as chief executive of the unit on March 8 rather than at the end of 1997 as previously planned.

But East Midlands had scorned that price, saying it would undervalue the Nottingham-based electricity company\'s prospects.\nExecutives from Dominion, the fifth U.S. utility to bid for a British power supplier, met East Midlands management late on Tuesday with a takeover price top of the agenda.\nEast Midlands chairman Sir Nigel Rudd said in a joint statement that his board was recommending the offer "because it represents fair value for an excellent business, which has successfully differentiated itself from the sector."\nEast Midlands shares were up 13 pence at 624 pence ahosrlty after 1400 GMT, off a high of 650 pence.\n"Everyone\'s expecting the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) to take a close look at the deal. That is why the shares are only trading around 630 pence," said one trader.\nSeven of the original 12 Recs have already been bought since they came up for grabs last March after the government\'s protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.\nNorthern Electric is currently fighting off its second hostile approach in less than two years, rejecting a bid at 630 pence per share from CE Electric, a subsidiary of U.S. energy group CalEnergy, which holds just over 29 percent of the\n"Dominion\'s offer looks a fair compromise price," said Chris Perry, utilities analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.\nBut he added there were "very genuine concerns" that the offer might be referred to the MMC.\n"If Dominion is allowed to buy East Midlands and CalEnergy secures Northern, that would leave only three independent Recs," one analyst said.\nBritish electricity watchdog Offer is expected to consult on Dominion\'s bid and then pass on its advice to Ian Lang, the trade and industry secretary, who will then decide whether the bid should be referred to the MMC.\nOffer has completed consultations on CalEnergy\'s bid and will be passing on its advice to Lang shortly, industry sources said.\nSo far, only generators National Power and PowerGen have had their bids for Recs blocked, as they would have created fully integrated generation and supply companies.\nDominion\'s chief financial officer Linwood Robertson said in an interview that the company was now talking to the regulator.\n"We intend to run this as a stand-alone business," he said, adding that he certainly hoped for approval from Offer.\nHe also said the group hoped to keep East Midlands\' management team, which is highly regarded by industry analysts.\nEast Midlands was the first of Britain\'s electricity utilities, which were privatised with strong cash balance sheets, to launch a share buy-back to redistribute cash to shareholders.\nRobertson said Dominion looked forward to the diversification East Midlands would bring to it and said the U.S. company would bring strengths to the British firm.

It paid a dividend of 4.4 pence, up from 4.05 pence and within forecasts of 4.4 to 4.6 pence per share.\nThe company, which completed its "Safeway 2000" strategic review in the summer aimed at boosting sales and cutting costs, said sales from existing stores were up five percent in the first five weeks of the second half.\nThat followed a 5.1 percent gain in the first half, including price inflation of 2.6 percent.\n"Our strategy to attract more family shoppers to our stores is succeeding and this success is reflected in sales growth which is outperforming the industry average," the company said.\nBut Smith said the sector was "very competitive...and margins at the moment are slightly down."\nSupermarkets are attempting to steer clear of an all-out price war by relying on marketing initiatives such as loyalty cards and customer service to boost sales, but pricing remains a key element.\nIn the first half, a fierce petrol price war hit profitability in Safeway\'s petrol forecourts to the tune of 10 million pounds, but Smith said he hoped this would not impact on the second half.\nGross margins have run slightly down on a year ago in the first half and start of the second half, Safeway said, driven by "our immediate and vigorous response to a number of significant marketing and pricing initiatives launched by our competitors."\nBut net margins were stable in the first half at 6.9 percent as productivity gains and efficiency improvements helped.\nThe supermarket chain plans to extend its innovative self-scan shopping, where customers track and total their own shopping to avoid queueing at checkouts. The scheme will be added at 50 stores on top of the current 100.\nSmith said the company would continue to focus on the family shopper and the large family weekly shop to boost sales.\n"Increasing efficiencies mean we can be a low cost operator...which allows us to afford to reinvest in being competitive."

a(S'When novice torero Ricardo Gomez steps into the arena and faces down a raging bull, only his fast-developing flair and a passion born of poverty lie between him and a gory end.\nArt and courage fuse as the 22-year-old swirls his cape and moves with the elegance of a dancer. The rays of the afternoon sun glisten on his Suit of Lights -- the bullfighter\'s traditional costume. But when the going gets tough, the 120 pound (54 kg), 5 foot 5 inch (1.7 metre) baker\'s son knows the most important lessons to remember are those he has learned growing up on the tough streets of Bogota, the Colombian capital.\n"I\'ve got more passion than a rich person. I\'ve had to put up with things in my life that a rich person would not have to suffer and when I get in front of a bull I have the same attitude. My daily life has given me one of the most important lessons for bullfighting," Gomez explained.\nAs a hand-me-down from Spanish colonialists, bullfighting -- the so-called fiesta brava -- has the image of a wealthy man\'s sport in Colombia. But while most of those in the stands at the capital\'s 15,000-capacity Santamaria bullring are from the nation\'s elite, the ones at the sharp end come mostly from humble origins.\nGomez is one of the rising stars of Bogota\'s fledgling school for bullfighters. His training programme, which he began at 16, includes pitting his wit against a contraption that resembles a shopping cart with horns. And for the last four seasons as a novice, he has cut his teeth on fighting the smaller bulls.\nLike scores of other youngsters, his dream is to become a top professional -- a major league matador. His performances on two consecutive Sundays in October have drawn rave reviews from critical crowds and the specialist press. If all goes well, he may get his chance at the big time when the main season starts in December.\n"I\'ve often thought what would happen if I don\'t succeed in becoming a matador but I don\'t worry. It\'s something that I have to achieve -- it\'s as simple as that," he said in a short break from training.\nEven if he does succeed in following in the footsteps of his idol Cesar Rincon -- reigning king of Colombian bullfighting -- 1,300 pounds (600 kgs) of killing machine will not be the only obstacle between him and living happily ever after. The sport\'s patrons are a wealthy minority who often value political and social contacts above ability, making it difficult for poorly connected youngsters to rise on merit.\nIn addition, every time a Colombian steps into the ring, he is fighting to get out of the ghetto that he has been cast into by a sport dominated by Spaniards.\n"Colombian bullfighters have always been on unequal terms compared to the Spanish. While the Spanish were going from one big bullring to another the Colombians have to travel by bus along dusty village tracks looking for bulls to fight," said matador Alberto "El Bogotano" Ruiz, the training school\'s resident instructor.\nWhen young hopefuls between the ages of 13 and 17 arrive at the school, Ruiz watches closely for a rare combination of intelligence, physical fitness, bravery and "the poor man looking for fame and the chance to live a little like the rich man." Fellow instructor Pablo Becerra separates bullfighters into those who are brave and those with great artistry. The brave ones, he says, fill seats and make millions as crowds flock to feel the fear and see if the bull finally gets its own back.\nBut far from the macho world portrayed in novelist Ernest Hemingway\'s "Death in the Afternoon" and "The Sun Also Rises," the head of Colombia\'s only bullfighting school does have his sensitive side. "Of course it\'s cruel to kill the bull but that\'s our job," Ruiz said. "But it\'s not like killing an enemy. We try to do it the best way possible. The fiesta brava is all about courage and death."\n'

a(S'Four people were killed and at least 33 injured on Tuesday when a powerful bomb ripped through a building in Monteria, the main town of Colombia\'s northwest Cordoba province, police said.\nThe blast occurred in the afternoon at the headquarters of the Fondo Ganadero, a fund set up to promote cattle-ranching in the province. Police chief Col. Gabriel Carrero blamed the attack on leftist guerrillas.\nThe explosion came a day after a 120 pound (50 kg) car bomb went off in Medellin, killing a woman and injuring 48 people. Authorities blamed that attack on drug traffickers in league with leftist guerrillas.\nMarxist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups have been waging a fierce battle for years in northwest Colombia where both blasts occurred.\n"Nobody has officially claimed responsibility for this (latest) attack but we know it is the work of subversives, terrorists and vandals," Monteria police chief Carrero said.\nThe blast in the downtown area of the small provincial town was the second explosion Monteria has suffered in the last two months. An 88 pound (40 kg) bomb, hidden in a street vendor\'s cart, exploded outside the town\'s police headquarters on Oct. 21, injuring 10 people in an attack that was  blamed on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country\'s largest guerrilla movement.\nIt is not yet clear whether Tuesday\'s bomb may be linked to a communique issued on Monday by a hitherto unknown group calling itself the Special Anti-paramilitary Commando.\nThe group, claiming to be made up of ex-rebels who had previously given up the armed struggle, declared war on the country\'s burgeoning paramilitary gangs. Human rights groups accuse cattle ranchers of backing the paramilitaries.\nDefence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra said he believed Monday\'s attack in Medellin was in retaliation for approval last week by Congress of a new law to strip drug lords of their illict billion-dollar fortunes.\nColombia\'s major cities, and particularly Medellin, was scarred by a drug-fuelled campaign of bombings, assassinations and kidnappings in the late 1980s as the late cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar waged war on the state in a successful bid to force Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.\n'

a(S'Icy relations with Washington appear to be thawing and Colombia has its eyes firmly fixed on overturning its status as an international drug pariah by this spring, diplomats and government officials say.\nColombia spent most of last year smarting at the U.S. decision to "decertify" it -- strike it off its list of allies in the drug war -- citing lax anti-narcotics laws and President Ernesto Samper\'s alleged ties with drug lords. That led to a cut in U.S. aid and sparked angry protests by Bogota.\nBut, in an about-turn from his normally hostile stance, U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette had glowing words of praise for the Colombian government on Wednesday.\n"We\'re very impressed by the teamwork demonstrated by the foreign relations, defence and justice ministers (in anti-drug matters). I have now sent my report and that will have to be reviewed and evaluated in Washington," he said.\nHis comments, at a funeral service for a U.S. civilian pilot killed on an anti-drug mission in Colombia, contrasted with his criticism of anti-drug legislation in Colombia\'s Congress late last year, which caused a political storm.\nNow Colombian authorities are hoping the appointment of outgoing Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra as ambassador to Washington, a successful drug crop eradication programme and a new law to strip cocaine kingpins of their assets will convince the United States to recertify Colombia.\n"We continue showing great political willpower to combat narco-trafficking and contribute to an efficient international struggle. Colombia deserves to be recognised and re-evaluated for the fight it has been waging on drugs," Col. Leonardo Gallego, head of the police anti-narcotics division, said.\nEsguerra will take up his diplomatic post on Jan. 20 and has pledged to "hammer on all the relevant doors" in a bid to win back certification and the U.S. aid that would entail.\nFormer Justice Minister Enrique Parejo, an anti-drug crusader who survived an assassination attempt ordered by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s, told Reuters on Thursday he thought it was likely Colombia would regain certification in March, but he still questioned Bogota\'s commitment to fighting the drug cartels head on.\n"The jailed kingpins of the Cali drug cartel continue running their criminal empires from behind bars and in the short term I don\'t see the political will or the operational efficiency to be able to launch a frontal assault on drug trafficking," Parejo said.\n"Colombia has been pressured by the United States into toughening its stance but I think Samper is looking to do just the bare minimum to regain certification," he added.\nThe United States annually certifies about 30 countries based on their cooperation in the international fight against drug production and trafficking. Decertification leads to a cut in most U.S. aid not linked to the fight against drugs.\nIn practical terms, Colombia has not suffered greatly from the reduction in aid because most of the U.S. financial help it receives is aimed at anti-drug programmes. Colombia is due to take delivery of 18 helicopters from the United States this year, enabling police to step up its drug crop eradication programme, seen as one of the most ambitious in Latin America.\n'

a(S'United News &amp; Media on Tuesday secured victory in a battle for control of international exhibitions group Blenheim with an agreed offer valuing the company at 592.5 million pounds ($935 million).\nThe deal will create the world\'s largest trade exhibition group with a turnover of more than 500 million pounds, based on 1995 figures.\nMedia and financial services group United said it had already secured acceptances for 51 percent of Blenheim after offering five pounds per share.\n"The acquisition will be earnings-enhancing in the first full year but the real attraction is the long-term growth we can get out by combining these businesses into one group," United chief executive Clive Hollick told Reuters.\nUnited News shares added 31 pence to 674-1/2 pence after the announcement, while Blenheim gained 22-1/2 to 496.\nDutch publisher VNU, which last week acquired a 15 percent stake in Blenheim, said it would not make a counter-bid and was likely to sell its stake. That decision effectively removed the threat of a bidding war developing for Blenheim.\nAnglo-Dutch media group Reed-Elsevier had been regarded as a rival suitor to United but sources close to the company indicated in the last few days that it had dropped out of the running.\nThe deal ends an on-off saga that began in June when Blenheim said it had received a bid approach. In August it said that talks with an unnamed party had broken down but then made another statement a few weeks later confirming a new approach.\nBased on 1995 figures, combined turnover and operating profit would be 545.5 million pounds and 88 million pounds, respectively.\nAnalysts said that Blenheim\'s geographical strength in continental Europe, and France in particular, made it a good fit with United.\nUnited\'s Miller Freeman subsidiary operates more than 100 exhibitions in the United States, Europe and Asia but the American market is seen as its main strength. These exhibitions are supported by a range of trade publications.\nBlenheim operates more than 170 exhibitions worldwide but does not have a significant publishing portfolio.\n"The directors of United believe that the Miller Freeman and Blenheim trade show portfolios are highly complementary geographically, by market sector, and in terms of operational management," United said in a statement.\nThe acquisition is the first major move by United since the national newspaper group merged with television and financial services group MAI earlier this year.\nThat merger doubled the size of the company, creating a British media major with a market capitalisation of more than three billion pounds.\n'

a(S'A $22 billion deal between British Telecom and MCI Communications Corp. that would create the world\'s second largest telecoms group looked set to be announced Sunday, sources close to the talks said.\nBT said it had scheduled a news conference for 8 a.m. EST Sunday at its Central London headquarters following an earlier announcement that it was in merger talks with MCI Communications Corp.\nA spokesman said he could not say what the news conference would be about, only that it would be in connection with recent developments.\nExecutives from BT and MCI were locked in separate board meetings on opposite sides of the Atlantic Saturday as they and their advisers attempted to stitch together the biggest deal ever in the rapidly expanding telecommunications industry.\nMCI, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, sent shock waves through the global communications industry Friday when it said it was in talks about a takeover by BT.\nBT, the dominant player in the British market, has been building its overseas presence in recent years and already has a 20 percent stake in MCI. The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.\nAnalysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.\nThe deal would be the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.\nA BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.\nBT\'s nine-story corporate headquarters was a hive of activity Saturday as bankers, lawyers and advisers worked alongside the BT board. A BT spokesman said that the MCI board was also meeting in Washington.\nBT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated. They have said a further announcement is anticipated before the London stock market opens Monday.\nBT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable &amp; Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world\'s fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.\nAny BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&amp;T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world\'s largest.\nAnalysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&amp;T.\nIts critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.\n"This is AT&amp;T Corp\'s worst nightmare," said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.\nAT&amp;T said late Friday it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.\n"We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom," it said.\nHowever, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.\nFor its part, Britain\'s Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.\n'

a(S'Shares in Britain\'s newly-demerged EMI Group Plc rose on Tuesday as the stock market applauded the company\'s resilience to tougher conditions in the music market.\nEMI, which split from rentals company Thorn Plc three months ago, said profit before tax and exceptional items rose nine percent to 112.5 million pounds ($188.4 million) in the six months to September 30. Net interim dividend per share increased by 12.7 percent to eight pence.\nEMI shares, which have shed some two pounds in recent weeks on fears that global music sales were faltering after a decade of strong growth, had added 9-1/2p to 1,280-1/2p by 1330 GMT after earlier climbing to 1290p.\n"These are excellent interim results from the EMI Group," chairman Sir Colin Southgate said in a statement.\n"They have been achieved against a background of variable growth in the major markets and mixed results from our competitors," he added. "The increase in the interim dividend reflects our confidence in the long-term health of the music industry and EMI\'s position within it."\nAnalysts said that EMI appeared in better shape than some of its rivals in a patchy worldwide market.\n"What we have seen from their competitors was poor but EMI is insulated as it does not have so much exposure to the U.S.," said media analyst Lorna Tilbian of brokers Panmure Gordon, adding: "They tend to be strong in the areas where the growth is coming through."\nPanmure are forecasting full-year profit excluding exceptional items of 403 million pounds and have a target share price of 1360p.\nFinance Director Simon Duffy said EMI remained confident that the global music business would continue to grow by some 6-8 percent annually in the medium to long-term.\n"This year is looking a little bit below that level," said Duffy, adding that markets were mixed but that overall first half music sales growth had been 5.5 percent. However, he added that the impact for EMI was diluted by the strength of sterling.\nThe market\'s sluggishness has recently been reflected by 100 layoffs at various labels within Warner Music and 400 job cuts at PolyGram NV -- two other music majors.\nEMI said that sales in the United States were almost flat and declined slightly in France. But this was offset by improvements in Japan, Britain and Germany while Southeast Asia and Latin America boasted particularly large gains.\nTurnover from the EMI Music division was down marginally at around 1.1 billion pounds but analysts ascribed this to the effect of exchange rates. Better margins helped to boost operating profits in the EMI Music division to 131.9 million pounds from 124.6 million.\nThe HMV division, grouping record and book stores chains, had an operating loss of 11 million pounds which the company said was in line with expectations.\nEMI said major releases for the key pre-Christmas quarter included the third and final Beatles Anthology album, which entered the American charts at number one.

a(S'Premier League Sunderland, one of the great names in the history of English soccer, said on Thursday that they hoped to raise up to 12 million pounds ($20 million) through a flotation on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe north-east club, which won the league title for the sixth and last time in 1936, joins a growing number of clubs seeking to capitalise on the popularity of the national game.\nPremier league rivals Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have full stock market listings while clubs such as Chelsea trade on the secondary market.\nOthers are expected to follow suit as revenue from a television deal with satellite broadcaster BSkyB and higher crowds help to transform the sport\'s finances.\nSunderland said that the new funds would be used to add the finishing touches to a new 15 million pounds stadium, reduce borrowing and fund the purchase of new players.\n"The proceeds will assist in retaining premier league status and enable the company to capitalise more fully upon the club\'s name, strong support and new opportunities arising from the move to the new stadium," chairman Bob Murray told a news conference.\nSunderland will leave their century-old Roker Park home at the end of the season and move to a 42,000-capacity stadium built on the site of a former colliery in the heart of the city.\nThe club, whose last real taste of glory came in 1973 when they won the F.A. Cup, are optimistic that the move to a new stadium will herald a period of prosperity on and off the pitch.\nSunderland were promoted to the premier league last season and forecast that increased gate receipts and television revenue would help double turnover this season to 13.6 million pounds.\nMurray said that the new stadium should allow Sunderland to boost its season ticket holders from 17,000 to around 28,000. Roker Park is in a dilapidated state and large parts of the 22,000 capacity ground are vast terraces open to the elements.\nSunderland, managed by former England international Peter Reid, have only a modest playing squad without the star names of neighbours Middlesbrough and Newcastle United. They are fifth from bottom of the premier league and are likely to face a battle to avoid relegation this season.\nThe club conceded that staying in the premier league status was "critical" but said that it believed that increased income from the new stadium would offset lost television revenue if the team did go down.\nSome 10 percent of the share issue will be made available to club employees and fans rather than institutional investors. The flotation is expected to value the club as a whole at 40-50 million pounds and share dealings will commence on December 24.\nChairman Murray and other leading shareholders, including manager Reid who has a six percent stake, have given undertakings not to dispose of any shares before early 1998.\n($ = 0.596 British Pounds)\n'

a(S'Britons will shortly learn how much they will be asked to pay to help fund the expansion of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio and television services in the multi-channel future.\nThe BBC has been lobbying the government to grant it an above-inflation increase in the annual licence fee, arguing that more money is needed if it is to remain at the forefront of broadcasting into the next millennium. The government is expected to announce its decision by early to mid-December.\nThe BBC, which calls itself "the world\'s most successful cultural institution", derives 95 percent of its funding from the annual fee payable by all television set owners.\nThe fee stands at 89.50 pounds ($150) and provided income of 1.8 billion pounds in the last financial year -- far outweighing the 77 million pound net benefit from the BBC\'s expanding commercial arm. The licence is guaranteed as a source of BBC funding for the next five years.\nBBC Director-General John Birt launched his campaign for what he said would be the first real increase in the licence fee in over a decade at a conference in Edinburgh in August.\n"If the BBC is to sustain the existing level of services; if it is to remain as creative and dynamic an institution in the 21st as it has been in the 20th century; if it is to innovate with high quality services in the new technologies...we shall need a real increase in the level of the licence fee," he said.\n"Neither a new leap forward in efficiency, nor a vigorous drive to increase our commercial revenue will be enough."\nThe BBC is believed to be seeking a rise of around five pounds -- which would generate extra revenue of more than 100 million pounds. Annual inflation is currently 2.7 percent.\nBirt\'s call has received a cool reponse from the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour, wary of pinning a price rise on more than 20 million households in the run-up to a general election. The new rate would take effect in April while the election must be held by the following month.\nRecent newspaper reports said that National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley has settled for a five-year formula that would leave the licence fee unchanged in real terms.\nThe reports said that Bottomley would offer higher rises in the second and third years to help fund new digital services and commercial projects but that increases in the following two years would be pegged below inflation.\nThe BBC, which runs two television channels and five national radio stations and has an enviable reputation as a quality public service broadcaster, has stepped up its campaign.\n"You want us to do things. We want to do them. Now please give us the means and we can get on with the job," Will Wyatt, chief executive of the BBC Broadcast division said in a recent speech.\n"We have called for only a modest increase, but one which would enable us to achieve a disproportionate amount of good."\nThe BBC points out that it has cut its cost base by almost 20 percent over the past three years and increased programme investment by 300 million pounds.\nThe licence fee debate comes as the broadcasting industry is set to be revolutionised by the move to digital transmission.\nDigital technology converts sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones. It increases picture quality, multiplies the number of channels that can be broadcast and allows for the creation of interactive services.\nPay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch\'s News Corp is the leading shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service with some 200 channels into Britain from next year.\nBSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s, is Britain\'s leading pay television operator with more than five million subscribers. Its top package of premium films and live sports events costs subscribers 324 pounds per annum.\nA terrestrial digital service, broadcast from land-based transmitters and offering some 36 channels, is expected to begin by mid-1998.\nThe BBC plans to use digital technology to offer all licence payers supplementary programming to its core BBC1 and BBC2 output plus a 24-hour news service. It plans to make them available via satellite and terrestrial distribution.\nThe BBC expects to retain a share of around a third of all viewing and listening in 2005, down from 45 percent as the number of channels multiplies and the market fragments.\nThe digital expansion creates fresh opportunities for the corporation to develop its BBC Worldwide commercial arm.\nWorldwide is in negotiations with partners in Britain and the United States over the creation of a number of subscription channels, exploiting its strengths in areas such as comedy, drama and natural history.\nIts partner in Britain is Flextech Plc, while it is working with Discovery Communications Inc on channels for international markets. Leading U.S. cable television operator Tele-Communications Inc is a major shareholder in both companies. It aims to launch its UK services in mid 1997.\nSome media figures doubt the sustainability of the licence fee as subscription and pay-per-view services proliferate.\nDavid Elstein, chief executive of Britain\'s new Channel 5 commercial television network, said recently that he believed that pay-per-view would eventually "consign the licence fee to history, where it belongs".

a(S'Monsanto Co. said on Monday it will spin off its chemicals business in a long-awaited and costly move that will allow the company to focus on its faster-growing agriculture, food and healthcare units.\nBetween 1,500 and 2,500 jobs will be eliminated in the transaction, causing the company to take a $400 million to $600 million fourth-quarter charge against earnings, it said.\n"What they\'re trying to create is one company that\'s clearly focused on growth and one that\'s clearly focused on efficiency," said Smith Barney industry analyst James Wilbur.\nSt. Louis, Mo.-based Monsanto is a far-flung conglomerate whose varied products include Roundup weed killer, NutraSweet sweetener, carpet fibers, and drugs for treating arthritis and insomnia, as well as genetically engineered corn and soybeans.\nWall Street had long expected the giant company, which has about $8.9 billion in annual sales, to break itself up.\n"It was a fait accompli," Wilbur said. "The market likes companies that are less diversifed."\nThe pared-down Monsanto will focus on its higher-profit margin agricultural, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology businesses, a spokesman said.\nThe new chemicals business will have to emphasize production efficiencies in a market subject to cyclical sales trends and intense global competition, analysts said.\n"After careful consideration, we\'re convinced these businesses must operate separately to reach their maximum potential and thereby unlock significant value in both," Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro said.\nShapiro will head the post-spin-off Monsanto and Executive Vice President Robert Potter, who runs the chemicals business, will run the new company, still unnamed, Monsanto said.\nThe scope of job cuts coming with the spin-off has not been determined, but more details will likely be available by the end of January, a spokesman said.\nMonsanto employs 28,500 people around the world. The anticipated cuts would reduce that headcount by 5 percent to 9 percent, the company said.\nThe tax-free spin-off proposed would create a new firm by the end of 1997. Current Monsanto shareholders would keep their Monsanto shares and get shares in the new concern as a special dividend, the company said.\nMonsanto said its directors approved the spin-off.\nThe company also said the exact amount of the after-tax charge, which is to cover the costs of job reductions, asset and equipment write-offs, and consolidation of some manufacturing and offices, would be fixed at a later date.\nAnalysts estimated the one-time charge would total between 80 cents and $1 per share.\nMonsanto, which reported 1995 profits of $739 million, or $1.25 a share, is expected to post per-share profits for 1996 of $1.50, according to First Call, which tracks analysts\' projections.\nMonsanto said in October it was considering options for its chemicals business, which had about $3 billion in 1995 revenues but is growing less rapidly than other units and is subject to more ups and downs.\n"Chemicals would hurt the multiple of the company if they held onto it ... because the chemicals growth rate is not as high as the agriculturals growth rate and the earnings are more cyclical," said PaineWebber industry analyst Paul Raman.\nThe chemicals business -- making acrylic carpet fibers, plastic interlayers for glass, industrial phosphorus compounds and other products -- was shopped around for months, but no buyer was found, in part for tax reasons, analysts said.\nMonsanto said the spin-off requires shareholder approval and clearance by government agencies and the Internal Revenue Service for it to be tax-free.\nThe spin-off is intended to be completed no later than the end of next year. Until then, the two companies will operate separately within Monsanto beginning early next year, it said.\nMonsanto\'s stock slipped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n'

And that\'s a lot of places," said Conning &amp; Co. insurance analyst Gary Ransom.\nAon Chairman Patrick Ryan said he could not estimate possible job cuts.\n"I don\'t think you should look for huge layoffs," he said.\nAlexander &amp; Alexander\'s stock jumped $3.125 to $17.25, while Aon rose $1 to $58.625, both on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlexander &amp; Alexander, based in New York, is the fourth-largest insurance broker in the world. It has operations in 80 countries, primarily the United States, Canada and Britain.\nAfter its acquisition of Alexander &amp; Alexander, Aon will become either the largest or second-largest insurance broker in the world.\nHow it will size up against rival giant Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Inc. depends on how their operations are counted, Ryan said. "It\'s not apples to apples," he said.\nAon said it will begin a cash tender offer for Alexander &amp; Alexander\'s common shares no later than Dec. 16 and upon completion of the tender offer the purchase of the preferred shares will begin.\n"Virtually everyone who watches the insurance industry has been expecting this deal," said Robinson-Humphrey insurance analyst Thomas Rosencrants.\n"It\'s a fair price. A&amp;A has been struggling for 15 years. There will be tremendous economies of scale to come out of this as A&amp;A is folded into Aon," Rosencrants said.\nAnalysts said they would expect Ryan to head up the combined operations and Alexander &amp; Alexander Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Zarb to step aside.\n"I would have to assume that Frank Zarb would not be around," Ransom said.\nThe deal was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, Aon said.\nOver the past decade, the insurance industry has become increasingly competitive and insurers have been forced to hold down premium rate increases, which has put downward pressure on their profit margins.\n"There\'s no end in sight to the 10-year soft market," Rosencrants said.\nCompetition has pressured companies to look for strategic alternatives and led to industry consolidation.\nAon in October completed a $250 million acquisition of Bain Hogg Group Inc. from Britain\'s Inchcape Plc. The Alexander &amp; Alexander deal likely caps Aon\'s acquisition drive for now, analysts said.\n"The industry has been consolidating. Certainly people have been expecting us to continue to be a leader in that," Ryan said. "We\'ve made two what we think to be strategic and good acquisitions. Now we\'ve got to put them together."\nAon added that its offer was still subject to several conditions, including the tender and non-withdrawal of at least a majority of the voting power of A&amp;A\'s common shares, and various regulatory approvals.\n'

Inc., Dayton Hudson Corp., Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. and others are "further confirmation that the holiday was one of moderate growth," Morgan Stanley retailing analyst Bruce Missett said.\n"There\'s a lot of nervousness about retailers and what they\'re going to report. It\'s definitely taking a toll on the stocks," said UBS Securities retailing analyst Annie Erner.\nJ.C. Penney said sales for the four weeks ended Dec. 28 were close to the Plano, Texas-based company\'s goals but that markdowns were higher than expected.\nTotal sales, including drug store sales, for the period were $3.6 billion, a 23.2 percent increase from the $2.9 billion in sales for the comparable period in 1995.\nSame-store sales at J.C. Penney, not including drug stores, for the holiday period increased 6.2 percent over 1995. The company did not release dollar figures for same-store sales, which cover stores open at least a year.\nThe company also said it expected fourth-quarter earnings before charges would not meet Wall Street expectations and that profit margins for November and December were below planned levels.\nJ.C. Penney stock dropped $1.25 to $47.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDayton Hudson said same-store sales at its 65 department stores in the Midwest, 736 Target discount stores nationwide and 300 Mervyn\'s discount stores in the West and South were up 4.2 percent for the same period. The Minneapolis-based company did not give dollar figures.\n"Results at Target and Mervyn\'s for the four weeks were on plan, while department stores sales were below our expectations," Chief Executive Bob Ulrich said in a statement. "With the shorter selling season this year, we planned our sales conservatively and generally met our plans for the season."\nDayton Hudson department store sales increased 0.3 percent, Mervyn\'s sales decreased 4.1 percent and Target sales rose 7.1 percent, the company said.\nDayton Hudson stock fell $1.375 to $37.875 on the NYSE.\nCarson Pirie reported a 12.8 percent increase in sales to $194.1 million for the four-week period. Same-store sales rose 7.6 percent.\n"The sales results during the 1996 holiday season were in line with my expectations," Chairman Stanton Bluestone said in a statement.\nBut the Milwaukee-based company, which operates 53 department stores and four furniture stores, said it expected five-week sales results for fiscal December will fall slightly below those for the five-week period ended Dec. 30, 1995.\nCarson Pirie and Dayton Hudson expect to report five-week results next week.\nLast Friday, Seattle-based Nordstrom Inc. warned that holiday sales would decline from year-ago levels and that earnings would be below Wall Street estimates.\nThe reports put retail analysts on edge, but they remained confident that other big names, such as Chicago\'s Sears Roebuck and Co., May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis, and Federated Department Stores, of Cincinnati, would meet or exceed expectations.\n"My impression is that May did okay. Federated looks like they\'re on plan and for Sears, we\'re looking for a good fourth quarter," said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Joseph Ronning.\nA big factor in the mixed sales performance for the holiday season was the fact that it was five days shorter than the previous year since the Thanksgiving holiday was later.\n"None of us knew what this five fewer days would do ... to the mechanics of the season," said Morgan Stanley\'s Missett.\nThe net result was that most big sales gains were restricted by the shortened season, while mediocre showings were made worse by it, analysts said.\n"You came out with a trend line not dissimilar to what we\'ve seen all year, which is modest growth," Missett said.\nCarson Pirie\'s stock dropped 25 cents to $25 on the NYSE. Among other retailers, Sears dropped $1.25 to $44.75 and May fell $1.25 to $45.50, both on the NYSE.\n'

a(S'The international partners in Australia\'s largest gas project said on Thursday they plan to spend A$6.0 billion to double production, making it Australia\'s largest single resources investment.\nAustralian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd said the partners in the North West Shelf gas project offshore Western Australia plan to double production capacity to 14.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) a year.  \nThe decision by the North West Shelf partners was unlikely to boost the much-touted prospect of a co-operative development with the nearby Gorgon gas field, which has the capacity to produce six million tonnes of LNG a year, analysts said.\n"The North West shelf partners have their own plans for expansion, but if the Gorgon partners have a good proposal that we can work together then we will certainly have a look at it," said Woodside\'s corporate affairs manager Geoff Wedgwood.\n"But to date we have not seen a plan from them that fits within our plans," Wedgwood told Reuters.  \nLast month an executive of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a partner in both projects, raised hopes that the two projects could be developed together and questioned the expansion of the Shelf on a stand-alone basis.\nCor Herkstroter, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell\'s committee of managing directors, then told Reuters in an interview that expansion of the North West Shelf could not be justified without integrating it with another project and that the development of both projects was a viable option.\nRoyal Dutch/Shell also owns 34 percent of Woodside.  \nWoodside, the project operator, said the expansion plan was submitted to the project\'s eight Japanese power and gas utility customers at a meeting in Osaka this week.\n"It is a significant step for the expansion of the North West Shelf project," Wedgwood said. The partners have spent A$12 billion on the project since it started in the early 1980s.\nWoodside is an equal one-sixth shareholder in the project along with some of the world\'s major oil producers.\nThe Osaka meeting followed indications from buyers in June of their interest in an expansion of the project, said Woodside.  \nHowever, work on the expansion would not start for another two years at least, Wedgwood said.\n"The next thing that is likely to be a letter of intent in late 1997 for the development of this expansion proposal," Wedgwood said. He said between now and then there are lots of talks on technical issues surrounding the proposal.\n"Following that would be a purchase agreement between the North West shelf partners and the Japanese buyers, which would be around late 1998," Wedgwood said.  \nOnly after this agreement would work start on the expansion. Besides Woodside and Shell, the other equal partners in the Shelf are The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Chevron Inc and a partnership of Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.\nShell and Chevron are also partners in Gorgon along with U.S. oil giants Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp.\n-- Sydney newsrooom 61-2 9373-1800\n'

a(S'The News Corp Ltd is expected to meet the 20 percent rise in net profit before abnormals for the year to June 30, 1997, predicted by its chairman Rupert Murdoch last month, Australian media analysts said on Tuesday.\n"They should do it easily," one Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters after taking part in an analysts\' conference call with News Corp following the release of its first quarter results.\nNews Corp earlier reported a lower than expected net profit before abnormals of A$285 million for the three months to September 30, slightly up from A$284 million a year earlier.  \nAnalysts had forecast net profit before abnormal items would be around A$320-330 million, up around 15 percent.\nThey said News Corp\'s results in Australian currency were hit by poor U.S. television results and a stronger local dollar.\nIn U.S. dollar terms, News Corp operating income was seven percent higher in the first quarter. The analysts said Murdoch\'s 20 percent profit lift forecast was in U.S. dollar terms.\n"They said that growth is still on for in excess of 20 percent and that is in U.S. dollar terms," another Melbourne based analyst said. She said News\' Fox Broadcasting U.S. TV network results should start to improve in the second quarter.  \n"I think you will find that there is more disappointment from the Australian viewpoint than the U.S. viewpoint," the second Melbourne analyst said.\n"I imagine there won\'t be too much of a downgrade with respect to people\'s full year forecasts," she said.\n"Basically, what News has said is \'the first quarter was a bit disappointing but you are still going to get your growth for the year\'," she said after taking part in the conference call.\nThe film, television, publishing and newspaper conglomerate reported a six percent fall in pre-abnormals net profit to A$1.26 million for the year to June 30, 1996.  \nNews Corp\'s net profit before abnormals and preference dividends is seen rising to around A$1.59 billion in 1996/97 according to the Barcep survey of analysts by BZW Australia.\nThe second Melbourne analyst said the second quarter is traditionally a stronger quarter for Fox Broadcasting and is likely to get a boost from the baseball World Series finals.\n"There is definitely room for recovery from the one-off things in this quarter -- if they don\'t then they have got problems," she said.\n"The second quarter is by far their biggest quarter and you wouldn\'t want to see any problems," she said.  \nAnalysts said the first quarter is also likely to be the quarter most affected by the stronger Australian dollar, which had averaged US$0.78 in the 1996/97 first quarter, compared with US$0.73 a year earlier.\nThey said that in the rest of 1995/96, the Australian dollar was mainly around US$0.75. The local unit is currently worth about US$0.78. News has 75 percent of its sales in U.S. dollars. The first Melbourne analyst said News Corp had leverage to earnings growth in its publishing related businesses, (newspapers, book publishing and magazines) which account for 55 percent of earnings, following the fall in newsprint prices.  \nThe first Melbourne analyst said he is forecasting News Corp to report a net profit before abnormals of A$1.63 billion in 1996/97.\nHowever, one Sydney analyst said he would be likely to cut his full year forecast from A$1.545 billion, excluding abnormals and before preference dividends. "I can see myself shaving that back to about the A$1,500 (million) mark," he said.\nAt 3.20 p.m. (0430 GMT), News Corp shares were 18 cents or 2.52 percent lower at A$6.95 with just over 3.96 million shares traded, wiping over A$300 million off its market capitalisation.\n-- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800\n'

a(S'Orange Plc said on Monday its customers will be able to use their mobile phones to chat, transfer data and send faxes in Germany, France, Switzerland, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore by the end of 1997.\nAnnouncing a roaming agreement with Swiss state-owned telecoms monopoly Swiss PTT, Orange Group technical and operations director Colin Tucker said he hoped customers would also soon be able to "roam" freely in Hong Kong and Scandinavia.\n"I suppose the thing to say is, Watch this space," he told a news conference in Geneva.  \nThe introduction of digital equipment has helped fuel the battle to add value to the basic mobile telephone by allowing free roaming from country to country and far more reliable and secure connections.\nOrange\'s 573,000 subscribers will be able to sign up for these enhanced services if they pass stringent credit checks and pay a 250 stg deposit to help curtail the fraud that has dogged similar previous agreements.\nOrange already has a full roaming agreement in Germany and a partial one in France, centred on Paris. Talks are under way to add a number of European and Asian nations to the list.  \nAs with all roaming agreements, the financial details of the Swiss deal remain a trade secret. Initially, only subscribers in Geneva will be able to use Swiss PTT\'s Natel City network but Orange aims to boost coverage to Basel and Zurich by early 1997.\nOrange says its offer of roaming services between the UK and other countries is part of its aim to provide customers with the best value for money. It notes that a significant proportion of users regularly use its established German services.\n"Adding Geneva as another roaming service demonstrates our commitment to providing an international continuity of service," Tucker said.  \nThe system that Orange uses is much like that of market leaders Vodafone Group and British Telecom\'s 60 percent-owned Cellnet, in that they are based on the GSM (global system for mobile communications) sister technology called DCS-1800, which operates at 1800 MHz as opposed to 900 MHz.\nMost of Cellnet\'s and Vodafone\'s subscribers are on the increasingly crowded analogue networks while Orange, along with rival Cable and Wireless- and U S West -owned Mercury One 2 One, is wholly digital.  \nAs mobile phone companies vie to lift the market out of its yuppie ghetto and into the mass market, the challenge for newcomers like Orange -- with its monthly rental packages that include free minutes and per-second charges -- is to attract customers who still have no mobile phone.\nIt also has to catch those as they move from the older analogue networks to the new digital technology. Orange, which last month reported gaping first-half pretax losses of 125.2 million stg, has seen its shares fall well short of the 205 pence level of its March flotation that valued the company at about 2.5 billion stg.\nBut the company, partly owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Wam Poa and British Aerospace, says its expects to turn in a profit or pay shareholders a dividend by 1998.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\n'

a(S'British telecommunications company Energis said on Friday that its parent, the National Grid electricity transmission network, might sell a majority stake in the company to one or more strategic investors this summer.\nThe group, which supplies telecoms services to about 14,000 business customers via the Grid\'s high voltage electricity pylons, also said it was poised to announce a continental deal in a move that will slash the cost of European telephone calls.\nChief executive Mike Grabiner, who moved from the country\'s dominant phone company British Telecommunications a year ago, said Energis had talked to all global carriers, with the exception of BT, in its search for international partners.\nAnd since the birth of a new cable giant -- Cable and Wireless Communications -- the company is also looking to gain access to key metropolitan areas.\n"I think both Energis and the Grid initially see the Grid selling a minority stake in the business," Grabiner told Reuters in an interview. But he added: "For the right mix of partners, I think they could go below 50 percent -- but still maintain a very large strategic and influential interest in the company."\nEnergis has been burning a 100 million pound ($168 million) per-year hole in the pocket of the Grid, which was demerged from the 12 regional electricity companies and floated in 1995.\nSome analysts say that a significant equity partner in loss-making Energis, that has been valued at more than 600 million pounds, could help inspire the Grid\'s lacklustre shares.\nHowever, Grabiner said talks with U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T were "not very active". Some analysts tip the Global One alliance between America\'s Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom as a potential partner.\nGlobal One has little British access and Energis has already signed a "correspondent agreement" with Sprint, America\'s third international carrier, to end each other\'s transatlantic calls.\nBut Energis is keeping its options open. It has also talked to "selected international strategic investors". "(A partner) hasn\'t got to be a global carrier. It has to be a partner who can support us and add value to the business," Grabiner stated.\nEnergis was set up in 1993 and operates one of the country\'s most advanced networks by wrapping 4,500 kms of fibre optic cables -- capable of transmitting images and data as well as voice -- around the earthwires between overhead power pylons.\nBut Energis still has to rely on local operators to originate and end calls.\nA five billion pound merger between Cable and Wireless\'s Mercury unit, NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron to create the country\'s biggest cable group has increased the pressure on Energis to get local access.\nTo be competitive with BT and Cable and Wireless Communications, Energis is considering linking up with other cable players, local operators or building its own network.\nIn the meantime, with an international licence safely under its belt, Energis is looking to spark an aggressive price war on European busines telephone routes with an "imminent" new correspondent agreement with a major telecom player.\nThe government broke the BT/Mercury duopoly on owning international calls networks last month, awarding 44 new international licences. Rivals, which used to be forced to lease line capacity from BT and Mercury at high prices, can now buy permament line capacity from others -- and save a lot of money.\n"We have a very small market share, a dramatically reduced cost base and every incentive to be aggressive on price to grow our market share. And we will do that," Grabiner said.\nLast October, Energis offered to undercut BT by about 50 percent with a 10 pence-per-minute charge for selected business customers on direct dialled calls to America. "European prices have further to go than North American prices," Grabiner noted.\n($1=.5958 Pound)\n'

a(S'Microsoft Corp said on Monday it had sent the final version of Office 97 -- a product that is expected to be its biggest revenue generator in 1997 -- to factories and will have it in stores within weeks.\nThe product, a package of Microsoft\'s top-selling business programs, is Microsoft\'s biggest new product since the release of Windows 95, and is expected by analysts to increase the company\'s revenue by about 15 to 20 percent this year.\nAbout half of Microsoft\'s $8 billion in revenue came from business applications last year.\n"People on the (Office 97) development team were jumping in the fountain this afternoon," just after Microsoft sent the final version to manufacturing, said Pete Higgins, Microsoft group vice president of applications.\nThe new version, which had been in development for more than two years, features better ties to the Internet, help tools that guide computer users through common tasks and a new component called Outlook, which manages computer users\' documents, appointments, contacts and electronic mail.  \nHiggins said the standard edition of Office 97 will cost about $239 for users of existing versions of Office. He said Office 97 will be available on a limited basis in December, and more broadly in early January.\nForeign versions of the product will be available a month to six months later, he said.\nAnalysts said the new version has several significant features that could goad corporate computer buyers to upgrade.\n"It will take some time to catch on because it requires a high-end PC," said Mary Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "But I think products like these are going to drive PC sales."\nOn Sunday, International Business Machine Corp\'s Lotus Development Corp unveiled its own suite of office applications, called SmartSuite 97, which it said would begin shipping in January.\nMicrosoft has roughly 70 percent of the market by unit volume, followed by Lotus with 23 percent, according to recent market research data.\n'

a(S'At this year\'s Comdex computer trade show, the most sought-after people are not Microsoft Corp.\'s Bill Gates or Intel Corp.\'s Andy Grove, but corporate computer buyers.\nPersonal computer makers and software vendors are relying heavily on their corporate customers this year to make up for disappointing sales to consumers, executives at the trade show said this week.\nWhile many consumers have been putting off their computer shopping until early 1997 -- when new gadgets come out -- corporate customers are finally dumping their older PCs and buying lots of machines that can run the latest business software from Microsoft.\n"Certainly we see a tremendously strong business environment as a major upgrade cycle is now occurring," said Michael Winkler, senior vice president at Compaq Computer Corp. "We think the fourth quarter will be excellent."\nWinkler and other PC executives said the recent release of Microsoft\'s Windows NT operating system and Office 97 package of business programs was fueling corporate sales. These programs work best with the computing horsepower of machines based on Intel\'s top-of-the-line Pentium computer chip.\nIn large part because of strong corporate sales, domestic PC shipments in the fourth quarter were expected to rise 20 percent to 8 million units, according to International Data Corp., a market researcher.\n"The bottom line here is that the outlook for \'97 for our business is very strong," said Jim McDonnell, a group marketing manager of PCs at Hewlett-Packard Co..\nBased on executives\' bullish comments at Comdex this week, stocks of most PC makers have gained in recent days.\nCompaq rose $1.375 to $81.875 and International Business Machines Corp. jumped $2.50 to $156.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange, while Intel added $1.75 to $122.50 and Sun Microsystems Inc. gained $2.50 to $59.50, both on Nasdaq.\nStill, the fourth quarter has been disappointing to some PC makers, especially those that concentrate heavily on consumer sales.\nLast year this time, the release of Microsoft\'s Windows 95, software that makes PCs easier to use, drew lots of people to computer stores to buy their first PCs. The industry has no such attraction this year.\nIn fact, analysts said, consumers were putting off computer shopping this Christmas season as the industry prepares new machines based on Intel\'s upcoming MMX technology. MMX-based machines, slated to be released in early 1997, will feature better video, sound and 3-D graphics.\nIn late October, computer stocks slid as CompUSA Inc. and other computer retailers reported softening sales heading into the crucial Christmas season.\n"There\'s no question that the quarter started out slow, but we\'re hopeful that things are getting better," said Mal Ransom, senior vice president of marketing at closely held Packard Bell NEC Inc., the second-biggest PC maker in the United States behind Compaq.\nConsumer sales appear to be improving as it gets closer to Christmas, while prices of computer components remain low, Ransom said. "It looks like we\'re going to get a reasonable quarter."\n'

a(S'Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and warned investors it did not expect to return to profitability until September.\nThe troubled computer maker attributed the loss to slow sales of its its consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the normally robust Christmas quarter.\nApple\'s loss, which equaled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales for its first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.\nBased on the weak first quarter results, the company said it planned to develop additional restructuring programs during the second quarter with the goals of reducing its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues and enabling Apple to return to  profitability by the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends Sept. 26, 1997.\nPreviously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March but industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.\n"While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound," said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson. "We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued to show improvements in our inventory management during the quarter.\n"Additionally we saw a 15 percent sequential increase in our high-end Power Macintosh sales," he said. "We significantly exceeded our internal plans for shipments of PowerBooks and expect their availability to continue to improve in the second quarter."\nNevertheless, analysts said the results, which Apple forecast less than two weeks ago represented a setback for Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who had set a goal of stanching Apple\'s losses in 1996.\n"Our expectations now do not show a profit until the fourth quarter, which ends in September," said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at brokerage PainWebber Inc. in New York.\n'

a(S'This year\'s rally on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada\'s biggest equity market, will stretch through 1997 and may last until the turn of the century, analysts forecast.\n"I think the Toronto Stock Exchange is in the middle of a bull market," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.\nCanadian equities investors have enjoyed spectacular gains this year. Toronto\'s key 300 Composite Index jumped as much as 28 percent in 1996 and was up 21 percent after a correction in December.\nBy contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average, which Toronto generally tracks, was up 23 percent this year, down from a peak of 26 percent.\nAnalysts said Toronto\'s market -- the 10th most active worldwide -- would continue to benefit from poor bond yields, which make stocks more attractive.\nBond yields have dropped across the board this year, with 50 basis points shaved off the return of Canada\'s 30-year benchmark bonds.\nMost of the seven analysts polled by Reuters said Toronto\'s 300 index next year would break its all-time high of 6,018 points, set on Nov. 28. The index was at about 5,700 on Friday.\nAnalysts\' median estimate for the 300 index was 6,600 points by the end of 1997, rising to 7,600 by 1998\'s close.\n"We\'re in a general long-term uptrend," said Katherine Beattie, technical analyst for MMS International in Toronto. "The stock market is still going to be the best place to invest given the relatively low interest rates.\n"We will start inching up, but even if we do get two or three interest rate hikes in the first couple of quarters next year -- which I think is going to cause a correction in the markets -- it\'s not going to put bonds or bills at a competitive enough level," Beattie said.\nFred Ketchen, senior vice-president at brokerage ScotiaMcLeod Inc, said Canadian equities were being snapped up by the large baby boom population focusing on generating wealth for retirement amid the uncertain future of government pensions.\n"I think that basically we\'re into fairly firm markets right through until the end of the century," Ketchen said. "Demographics are certainly helping here."\nJosef Schachter, president of Schachter Asset Management Inc., predicted Toronto\'s heavily weighted resource sectors could push the 300 index to 7,000 by the end of 1997 and to at least 8,500 a year later.\n"I see (it) potentially higher than that if we can get precious metals ... and base metals joining the party," Schachter said.\nMontreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels forecast the index would climb to 8,000 by the end of 1998 and 10,000 by the year 2000.\nBut some analysts were more bearish, with John Ing, president of Toronto-based Maison Placements Canada Inc., predicting the index would sink to 5,750 by the end of 1997 and 5,400 by the end of 1998.\nIng said interest rate hikes would cut the party short.\n"The inevitable increase in rates has got to happen sometime within the next 12 months and that will test the markets," Ing said.\n'

Trading was brisk at 120.9 million shares worth C$2.1 billion ($1.57 billion).\nHeavily-weighted gold stocks began the day stronger, but turned softer amid volatile bullion prices.\n"We had a negative reversal in gold," said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.\nMidland Walwyn analyst Dunnery Best said investors reaped the benefits of Toronto\'s recent rally by selling some holdings.\n"Little bit of profit-taking here and there," Best said, adding "it\'s been a heck of a run."\nToronto posted four record closing highs during a seven-day winning streak which was broken by Monday\'s decline.\nBeattie said short-term losses could be expected after a gain of about 215 points. "A one-to-three day pull-back is not surprising," she said.\nTraders began the day nervously awaiting comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the U.S. economy, but his generally upbeat assessment was a boost for Wall Street equities.\nIn Toronto, all 14 sub-indices slipped except transportation, pipelines and real estate.

a(S'Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses, confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate, probably belongs to China\'s strategic state reserve, industry sources said on Friday.\nAround 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where some of the strategic stockpile was stored, they said.  \nJust who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) in June and July.\nIt was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve, administered directly by the central government\'s State Planning Commission, owned the copper.\nTraders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise.  \nBut one source, the head of a Hong Kong trading house, said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not.\n"If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou, it will be sitting there for years," he said.\n"Once it arrives in Yingkou, it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission, which has to give permission for any more movement; it is out of the hands of traders," he said.\nMystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months, with traders unsure not only of who owns it, but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it.  \nTrading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange (LME).\nA backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price.\nCNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve, running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously.  \nTraders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$2,700 a tonne, and then paid somewhere between $2,200 and $2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year.\nThis would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit, which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs.\nWord that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market.  \nIndustry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes, "whoever they are, is the most important short-term fundamental" in an already tight world market.\nBME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp, with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals.\nSumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement.  \nTraders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses. They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases.\nThey also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market.\nBut these concerns were irrelevant, a Singapore trader said, despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year.  \nAs with many commodities, "there is a desire (by the Chinese government) to keep a stockpile of the metal," he said. "You don\'t keep it to help industry, you keep it in case of emergency."\n-- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843-6470\n'

a(S'China has agreed not to enforce a ban on imports of U.S. poultry until after top-level quarantine talks scheduled to take place in Beijing next week, U.S. business and diplomatic sources said Tuesday.\n"We understand they (the Chinese authorities) have not issued any letter to the field banning imports, and that they will not until discussions are held," a senior diplomat in Beijing said.\nChina last week confirmed a ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states because of fears of a fowl plague known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI.\nChina is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and is its only market for chicken feet.\nU.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.\nThe states affected are Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.\nOfficials from Washington\'s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were to arrive in Beijing next Monday for talks with China\'s Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine on Wednesday, the diplomatic source said.\n"We have been told they will hold off on any action until then," he said.\nNews of the ban surfaced on Oct. 10, when the U.S. agriculture attache in Beijing confirmed to his head office that China feared U.S. poultry products bore the HPAI virus.\nU.S. officials say U.S. poultry is free of HPAI virus and that Chinese quarantine personnel are confused about the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI.\n"We don\'t know what they identified," an APHIS official told Reuters. "All we can say is that HPAI is not found in the U.S. The last time it was found (in 1984) it was eradicated and since then we have had no reports of HPAI at all."\nAI is prevalent the world over, especially in wild fowl, and had not been isolated in commercial U.S. poultry flocks, he and other U.S. sources said.\n"AI is not a concern for vets -- it\'s like the common cold and is not quarantinable," the APHIS source said.\nU.S. and meat industry sources said the HPAI virus had been detected in ostrich breeding stock in the United States destined for ostrich farms in China.\nDuring a trip to Texas by CAPQ personnel to look at U.S. ostriches, 22 birds had tested positive for HPAI, a U.S. source said.\nA positive test did not necessarily mean the bird was ill with HPAI, he said, likening it to a tuberculosis skin test which, if positive, did not definitively indicate the presence of TB.\n'

a(S'China\'s ban on poultry imports from two U.S. states, aimed at preventing a deadly epidemic, is unlikely to be mired in the politics of Beijing\'s bid to join the World Trade Organisation, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.\n"They (Chinese authorities) are very sensitive to any sort of disease profile," Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, told Reuters.\nChina\'s Ministry of Agriculture and the State Bureau of Animal Plant and Quarantine said the ban on poultry products from Oklahoma and Missouri went into effect on Monday.\nOfficial news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two rural states because five cases of a deadly poultry flu were discovered between July and September.\nChina\'s Xinhua news agency described this virus, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, as an "extremely harmful contagious epidemic disease". Holloway agreed. "It\'s a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases," he said. "The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die."\nBut Holloway said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.\nThe U.S. embassy in Beijing issued a statement confirming the Chinese ban but would not elaborate. Other U.S. agricultural officials were not immediately available for comment.\nSome U.S. industry sources suggested the ban could be connected with Beijing\'s tit-for-tat trade disputes with Washington and timed to coincide with the first ministerial meeting of the 128-member World Trade Organisation in Singapore.\nBut Holloway said this was unlikely.\nThe last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state\'s entire poultry population, he said.\nThe poultry industries of Oklahoma and Missouri were far down on the list of top U.S. producers and exporters, he said.\n"My estimate is that Oklahoma and Missouri account for less than five percent of U.S. poultry exports to China," he said.\nArkansas is the country\'s biggest poultry producer and home of industry giant Tyson Foods Inc.\nA source at Tyson\'s Hong Kong office said VVND was known to exist in China, but this could not be confirmed.\nThe United States exports around US$500 million of poultry and poultry products a year to China, its biggest market after Russia.\nCanada reported one case of VVND, found in a wild cormorant, in October, a Canadian embassy official in Beijing said.\nUnder existing protocols between Ottawa and Beijing, Canadian poultry exports to China did not cease, and neither volume nor value was affected, the embassy source said.\nBut all Canadian poultry must be now certified as not coming from the area where the dead bird was found, he said.\nThe current Chinese ban comes only weeks after the resolution of another dispute that saw Beijing ban all U.S. poultry imports because of fears they carried highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI.\nU.S. officials said Chinese authorities had mistaken HPAI for the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI. The United States flew in experts to meet with Chinese officials.\nThat ban was lifted before being implemented.\n-- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6470\n'

a(S'Russia, dramatically changing its approach to foreign investment in its huge oil sector, said on Monday that new domestic companies, not Western majors, would be given the upper hand in future billion-dollar energy deals.\nVladimir Tumarkin, chief spokesman for Rosneft, the state oil holding company which is being privatised and the state\'s agent in production-sharing deals, said the days of foreign oil firms winning majority stakes to tap Russian reserves were over.\n"We have a new approach," Tumarkin said. "We do not wish to repeat the so-called mistakes of earlier deals, when majority stakes went to foreign companies and Russia was left out."\nHe told Reuters he was referring to three, high-profile deals with Western and Japanese oil investors off Russia\'s Far Eastern island of Sakhalin -- deals in which Russian equity and ownership play a relatively minor role.\nAs a test of the new approach to Western oil investors, he said Amoco Corp, Exxon and Texaco of the United States, Total SA of France and Norsk Hydro ASA of Norway -- all bidders in a recent tender to develop reserves in Timan-Pechora -- would be asked to form a consortium and to give at least a 50 percent stake to Russian companies.\nThe companies had bid, some individually, some together, to develop up to 200 million tonnes of crude oil in the Khoreiverskaya Basin in oil-rich northern Timan-Pechora.\n"The philosophy behind investing in Russian oil has changed," Tumarkin said, adding that Rosneft would hold talks with the companies next week.\nForeign oil investors are already wondering about the extent to which Moscow truly wants outside help in developing reserves in Russia, the world\'s third largest crude oil producer.\nLots of competitive investment dollars have gone to energy-rich Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, where deals have got off the ground faster and more smoothly.\nBut while Russia has said it wants to turn around its flagging oil sector, where output has declined by 46 percent since the mid-1980s, its newly-privatised oil companies may not be able to carry the banner.\n"The question is, do the Russian companies have the financing for all this," said oil analyst James Bunch at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.\nSome of Russia\'s vertically-integrated oil companies have the makings of future stars, with savvy management and reserves that put them in the world\'s big league. But many of them are weighed down by non-payments and corporate taxes that leave them little free cash to invest.\n"I don\'t think the size of stakes (in production-sharing contracts) makes that much difference to Western companies -- what is important is the economics of the deal," said oil and gas analyst Stuart Amor of CS First Boston in London.\nHe said it was doubtful whether Russian companies could find the money needed in the near-term to work with foreign investors and that crude oil output levels were, as a result, unlikely to rise significantly.\nU.S. energy companies have invested less than $1 billion of the $60 billion they have said they plan to commit to Russian oil deals, complaining of political and legal risk.\nProminent projects -- including the $40 billion international Timan Pechora Company deal, and Amoco\'s $50 billion plan with Russian oil group YUKOS to tap Priobsk reserves -- are beset by quibbles with the Russians over equity stakes, contributions, and asset valuations.\n"They\'re obviously not going to like it," said one Western analyst of Russia\'s new approach. "But I don\'t know if it will drive them out."\n'

a(S'Russia\'s grain crop is proving to be one of its lowest in three decades, prompting trade sources on Monday to speculate that the government could return to world markets for imports to feed the military and remote areas.\nThe nearly complete 1996 harvest, bucking a trend of increased grain output across the world, weighs in at a gross 74.6 million tonnes, with little high-quality bread wheat and virtually no stocks from last year\'s disastrous output, which was the worst for more than 30 years.\n"The figure is, I think, slightly lower than we expected," said a Western agriculture source, commenting on preliminary data published by the State Statistics Committee on Friday.\n"It means additional imports."\nThe cash-strapped Russian state insisted last year it had long ago left world markets for good.\nBut Anatoly Manellya, head of agriculture forecasting at the Centre for Economic Trends, a think-tank set up by the Russian government, said the Federal Food Corporation, the state agency responsible for reserves to feed the armed forces and remote towns, might soon be in the international market.\n"The Federal Food Corporation is probably going to try to do some deals," he said, adding only that it was in preliminary negotiations.\nThe agency has bought a mere 450,000 tonnes of domestic grain out of the 4.5 million tonnes it plans to buy this year.\n"As far as I know, the government is talking about possible imports for us, but I cannot tell you anything more since we merely fulfil government orders and they have not yet told us anything," said Corporation deputy director Yuri Lysenko.\nRussia\'s harvest last year was officially 63.4 million tonnes and record-high world grain prices kept traders from importing any significant quantities from beyond the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\nThis year prices are lower after bumper world harvests, with benchmark Chicago contracts at $3.75 per bushel after a long spell above $5 and a spike to $7.50 in March.\nBut Russian farmers, mindful of recent high prices, have declined to sell to state reserves -- making government officials jittery over how to feed the soldiers and isolated Arctic cities that cannot depend on the private sector.\n"It seems like more and more contracts are being talked, especially in the (Russian) Far East," said the Western source, who forecast Russia\'s total grain imports over the 1996/97 crop marketing year from all sources at five million tonnes.\nAndrei Sizov of the private agricultural consultancy SovEcon Ltd recently put the total at six to seven million tonnes.\nAllowing for the eight or nine percent that is lost after cleaning, Russia\'s 1996 net harvest will probably weigh in at a lean 68 to 69 million tonnes -- not much above last year.\nManellya said he had told the cabinet last week that net output would be 69.8 million tonnes.\n"This is better than last year, but is still one of the three worst harvests in the last three decades," he said.\n-- Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520\n'

a(S'President Boris Yeltsin\'s surgery on Tuesday might be a heart stopper for some volatile commodities and currency markets, but recent history proves Russian oil and gas exports are unfazed by Kremlin dramas.\nTraders have seen tanks fire at Russia\'s White House, cloak-and-dagger power struggles and war in oil-rich Chechnya -- and each time, they say, Russian supplies of oil and natural gas to Europe and the Mediterranean have held steady.\nRussia is the world\'s third-largest crude oil producer and single biggest natural gas producer; its energy heats and powers much of Europe and is a multi-billion dollar cash cow for Russia no matter who sits in the Kremlin hot seat.\nThis time, with Yeltsin under the knife this morning for a gruelling, hours-long heart bypass, should be no different.\n"Politics don\'t affect us," said trader Vladimir Solovyov of Nafta-Moskva, one of Russia\'s leading oil exporters.\n"We are more interested in things like government decrees saying \'export tariff introduced\' or \'export tariff scrapped\'.\nYeltsin\'s surgery began against domestic and international worries that if the operation fails, Russia could plunge into political uncertainty that could hit oil and gas exports.\nWith about one third of Russia\'s 6.2 million barrels per day output exported outside the former Soviet Union, and with Russian natural gas keeping one third of Europe warm, it is easy to see why traders worry about supply.\nBut when Russian oil exports do fluctuate, it is on less dramatic events, like storms at the Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk, one-off government supply programmes to former Soviet allies and which oil company is flavour of the month with export officials.\nGas exports can fluctuate on occasional explosions in Russia\'s gas pipeline system, the largest in the world.\nAnalysts said that with domestic demand flat while the Russian economy recovers, exports will be stable near-term.\nIndustry sources said there is no danger of conservative officials playing with the taps while Yeltsin was incapacitated, but they said some risk-averse European buyers could insist on contract terms less beneficial to Russian exporters.\n"Our partners could get worried and demand terms not as attractive to us," said a trade financer at International Economic Cooperation, or MES, another leading oil exporter.\nOthers said money, not politics, motivated exports -- and with domestic oil prices below world levels, it is not hard to make money exporting the stuff.\n"We like good prices on world markets," Nafta-Moskva\'s Solovyov said.\nPolitical tensions in other major oil exporting countries often cause benchmark London and New York oil prices to leap over worries about supply disruptions.\nNervous International Petroleum Exchange traders swung spot prices in London when Yeltsin sacked maverick security tsar General Alexander Lebed last month.\nBut Moscow oil traders and analysts said that everyone should just calm down.\n"This stuff (oil) is scheduled for export months in advance and it\'s technically very difficult to fiddle with the taps," said energy analyst Peter Houlder of CentreInvest consultancy.\nEven the conservatives who covet Yeltsin\'s Kremlin seat remember the good old Soviet oil-boom days, when exports -- not disruptions to them -- were the key to power and wealth and enticed the Soviet Union to crank up output and become the world\'s largest oil producer.\n'

a(S'Russia\'s aluminium industry, in private hands and learning market-savvy moves in ways its former state owners never could, still holds surprise cards but may no longer terrorise world markets with sudden, secret exports.\nMetals analysts said on Friday that Russia, which accounts for about 15 percent of world output, would not cut production or exports in 1997 even in the face of rising costs at home, low margins and weak world prices.\nInstead, smelters -- now mostly in private hands after years of turbulent shareholder battles -- would do all they could to turn profits.\n"What has happened over the last year in particular is that ownership has settled down so that you can be fairly sure of the conduits of the smelters\' metal," said a senior London metals trader who declined to be identified.\n"They will continue to sell the metal, come what may."\nRussia, fresh off a two-year global output cutting agreement that expired this spring, seized the opportunity to restart some idled capacity and increase exports.\nThe increases laid to rest market talk that Russia wanted to craft a new output cutting deal to boost low London Metal Exchange prices. But analysts still wonder how much Russian aluminium could flood onto sensitive markets.\nAsked if Russia had learned anything from the March 1994 memorandum of understanding that reduced global output 10 percent to draw down bloated stocks, the senior London source said, "It has not learned. I don\'t think they care."\nIgor Prokopov, director of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the producers\' group uniting Russia\'s aluminium industry, said 1996 primary aluminium output would rise 1.5 percent from 1995 to 2.79 million tonnes.\nProduction could rise another 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 1997.\nThe group put Russian 1996 primary aluminium exports at 2.37 million tonnes, against what it said were 2.11 million in 1995.\n"Some noise has appeared in the West that Russia has cranked things up, which is not really true," Prokopov said.\nBut two base metals analysts said the figures seemed on the low side and Russian smelters had undoubtedly increased output.\nBut they have done so while consolidating sales operations to try to make more money on exports, which has introduced more transparency into deliveries abroad.\nShareholders, many of them Western commodities power houses, were having a greater hand in that transparency, since they were increasingly buying direct from smelters.\nPechiney of France, Glencore AG of Switzerland and London-based powerhouse Trans-World Metals and its units already have major stakes in Russian smelters.\nAnalysts said the Bratsk smelter, the world\'s largest, with annual capacity of about 850,000 tonnes, had major plans to modernise with the help of a top European industrial firm.\nLME three-month aluminium futures are around $1,550 a tonne, clawing back from October\'s 2-1/2 year low of $1,305 but below a $2,195 in January 1995, the last major peak.\nPrices had been even lower before Russia and five other countries -- the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the European Union -- signed the 1994 accord. The five said Russia was to blame because it had flooded markets with metal.\nThose exports were largely orchestrated by the state, which needed cash to fill its coffers.\nNow smelters say they are reining in trade and marketing operations to be closer to markets in a way that Soviet-style ministries in Moscow were not.\n"Integration could have a positive affect," Prokopov said, citing expense rationalisation and consolidated balances.\nRussia is an aluminium powerhouse because its Siberian smelters, which account for 90 percent of output, have endless, cheap hydroelectricity generated by rivers.\n'

a(S'French state-owned airline Air France said on Thursday it was ready to take on the toughening competition in its domestic market posed by British Airways Plc (BA).\nBA\'s TAT French unit on Wednesday announced a joint 780 million franc bid ($151.2 million) with bank Rivaud for domestic carrier Air Liberte that will double its share of takeoff and landing slots at Paris\' busy second airport Orly to 20 percent.\nAn Air France spokeswoman acknowledged BA\'s increased presence in France aviation would have an impact.\n"It certainly has consequences for us. But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices," she said.\nAfter approval by the Creteil commercial court, scheduled to meet on Friday, and an Air Liberte creditors meeting due within a month, BA would take a 70 percent stake in loss-making Air Liberte.\nA spokesman for Air France Europe, the domestic wing of the Air France operation, said the company had an 80 percent market stake on the routes it operates and 60 percent on the total French market.\nBut from April 1997, European liberalisation of the airline industry will fully throw open French airspace to competition.\nThe French government moved the door ajar at the start of 1996 by allowing competition on the busy Paris-Toulouse and Paris-Marseille routes which were controlled by state-owned Air Inter, part of the Air France group.\nOther French airlines had been allowed to fly less busy domestic routes as well as European and international routes.\nBritish Airways bought its first 49.9 percent stake in TAT in 1993 and obtained the remainder last July.\nAir Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war against Air France Europe, the renamed Air Inter. As a result they have suffered financially.\nAOM, headed by Alexandre de Couvelaire, had been in talks with Air Liberte with an eye to a merger but the worsening financial situation at Air Liberte, which sought creditor protection on September 26, made a deal impossible.\nAOM, 99 percent owned by the Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which was set up to sell assets of bank Credit Lyonnais, is now going it alone with some 10 percent of the slot at Orly.\nBut industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside British Airways.\nAir France Europe plans to launch its "Shuttle" service between Paris and Toulouse next Monday, offering more departure times and a "turn up and go" service without reservations, as a major plank in its new commercial approach.\nOther airlines in France are Air Littoral, owned by the Dufour family, the Dubreuil family\'s Regional airlines, Xavier Leclerq\'s Brit Airlines as well as Nouvelles Frontieres\' Corsair and Euralair.\nFor Air France, these domestic lines are important potential feeder operations for its international operations.\nLast week the company signed cooperation pacts with Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines Inc of the U.S. and Air France aims to sign a similar deal with an Asian ailrine in 1997.\nThese pacts are based on the "hub and spoke" theory in which airlines boost traffic by taking passengers from a smaller airport to a big "hub" for long distance flights to another hub. From the second hub another smaller plane can be used to take the passenger to the final destination. ($1=5.157 French Franc)\n'

a(S'French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Tuesday he wanted a public debate on the planned privatisation of electronics group Thomson SA after an outcry over an earlier government decision.\n"Once the (privatisation commission) has delivered its ruling, and whatever its content, I will ask for a public debate on all the issues of this case, financial, industrial and social, so that we can have all the cards on the table before the government decides and everybody takes their responsibilities," Juppe told parliament during question time.\nThe government said on October 16 it wanted to sell loss-making and indebted Thomson SA to books-to-missiles conglomerate Lagardere Groupe instead of to industrial and telecommunications group Alcatel Alsthom.\nThe government planned to sell Thomson for a symbolic franc after an 11 billion franc ($2 billion) capital increase.\nLagardere plans to merge Thomson\'s 58-percent owned Thomson-CSF defence electronics group with its own Matra Defence Espace into the world\'s second-biggest defence electronics group.\nAs part of its plan, it agreed to sell Thomson\'s wholly-owned consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea, also for a franc.\nJuppe told parliament on Tuesday that he personally made the decision to favour Lagardere because it was in the best interests of the country\'s defence industry and job market.\nThe Privatisation Commission, a body of seven independent experts, is currently studying both offers and has to state whether the bids reflect the true value of Thomson and whether it agrees with the government\'s preference.\nIts decision is expected in early December.\nNormally, a privatisation can go ahead if the commission agrees with the government preference, but the sale procedure has to be restarted if the commission does not agree.\nThe government normally does not announce its preference but Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said he decided to do so to avoid any insider dealing in shares of Lagardere, Alcatel or Thomson-CSF.\n"I don\'t see them turning back on their decision," a share trader said about the debate. "I think they\'re doing this to allow them to respond to criticism and explain their decision."\nThomson Multimedia\'s labour unions are upset by declarations by Juppe that their company was not worth one franc, but minus 14 billion francs, the level of its debts.\nThomson Multimedia chairman Alain Prestat told Le Monde on Tuesday the company would be automatically profitable from 1998 due to technology licensing rights.\nThe company made a 2.8 billion franc loss in the first half of 1996, Prestat said.\nAnother criticism also emerged about the way the government announced its preference before the Privatisation Commission had studied the offers.\nLionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party and rival to Jacques Chirac in last year\'s presidential elections, openly wondered whether the government had acted illegally.\n"I was shocked by the method, which was despicable and perhaps even illegal," he told a television interviewer on October 20.\n($1=5.113 French Franc)\n'

But the debate will not be followed by a parliament vote on the proposal.\nIn full-page advertisements in most French newspapers on Wednesday, Daewoo said that its electronics arm had about the same sales figure as Thomson Multimedia, at some 40 billion francs, although with a big profit which the French company lacks.\nIt said that its global sales network, especially in Asia, would allow better market access for Thomson\'s new products such as flat screen television sets and televisions that can be connected to the Internet computer network.\nThe company also said that "Daewoo believes in France" and said it had made investments in the country and had close ties with a number of French companies.\n"Contrary to all other competitors who have based themselves or moved to neighbouring countries, Daewoo has chosen France. Simply because it believes in France".\nParliamentarians of the Communist Party are organising a seminar on the privatisation of Thomson on November 13. They want the promised parliament to be televised and join a call by the Socialist Party for an inquiry commission to study the way the government came to its decision.\nThe European Commission, meanwhile, is studying the Lagardere bid as well as a rival offer by Alcatel Alsthom and could make its findings on competition issues and the state cash injection known by December 4.\nDutch Philips Electronics has sounded out Commission officials about the posibility of lodging a complaint agaisnt the capital injection for its rival Thomson Multimedia but a spokesman in Eindhoven said the company was at the moment not planning such a complaint.\nFrench media keep speculating that some minisiters, mainly Industry Minister Franck Borotra, are hoping for the Privatisation Commission to declare the bid void because of the size of the capital injection.\nLe Nouvel Economiste, a two-weekly paper, said that Philips, Samsung and Toshiba had all turned down offers from Lagardere to acquire Thomson Multimedia.\nIn the case of Philips this was because of competition concerns, the paper said.\n'

a(S'France\'s state-owned electricity utility Electricite de France (EDF) said on Wednesday it had made a 850 million franc asset gain selling its 10 percent stake in Sweden\'s Sydkraft AB to Norway\'s Statkraft SF.\n"It allows us to realise a big asset gain and the deal is also the start of an alliance with Statkraft," EDF chairman Edmond Alphandery told a news conference.\nEDF officials said the alliance with Statkraft, also a state-owned utility, would mainly be in the form of cooperation in hydroelectric projects in southeast Asia.\nEDF is selling its 6.808 million class A and 12.395 million class C shares in Sydkraft AB to Statkraft for a sum of 2.130 billion francs. This allows the Norwegian firm to increase its stake in Sydkraft to 15 percent. The formal transfer of ownership will take place in November.\nEDF took its stake in Sydkraft, Sweden\'s biggest power firm, two years ago but it changed its strategy in April when its Northelec unit obtained a 25 percent stake in Graningeverkens AB, Sweden\'s number six power group. It later raised the stake.\nNorthelec is a joint venture with Skanska.\n"It\'s better to have a big stake in a small company than to have a small stake in a big company," Alphandery said.\n"At Sydkraft we did not even have a seat on the board, at Graninge we have a shareholders\' pact allowing us to effectively control the company," he added.\nEDF has a shareholders pact with Sweden\'s industrial family Versteegh and jointly they own 54 percent of Graninge.\n"We saw the strategic value of the Nordic market and we have been able to cash in on the asset gain because the value of Sydkraft shares has risen a lot," he said.\nAlphandery, a former economics minister named to EDF in November to replace Gilles Menage who was an appointee of the former Socialist government and an aide to Francois Mitterand, said the sale was proof of EDF\'s willingness to "realise an asset gain when there is one."\nHe did not expect further sales from EDF\'s international portfolio. The French utility in 1996 alone has made commitments totalling 4.6 billion francs in foreign stakes and Alphandery said EDF would continue its expansion mainly in the Mercosur area in Latin America and in southeast Asia including China.\nEDF obtained a stake in Brazil\'s Rio de Janeiro power utility Light and Edenor in Argentina. Last year, it obtained stakes in two Hungarian companies. It als has investments in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ivory Coast and South Africa.\n"We can use the asset gain on Sydkraft to finance our international expansion," Alphandery said.\n"This refocusing of Northern European strategy shows EDF\'s desire to be a major international and industrial operator, actively managing its investment portfolio," EDF said.\nEDF\'s decision to leave Sydkraft makes Germany\'s Preussen Elektra AG, a unit of Veba AG, the biggest shareholder with 17.6 percent of shares and 27.1 percent of votes. The city of Malmo is second biggest with 11.8 percent of shares and 18.9 percent of votes, followed by Statkraft and some pension funds.\nSydkraft has a 20 percent stake in Graninge and Veba\'s Preussenelektra 12.4 percent.\n'

a(S'French carmakers Renault SA and Peugeot PSA said on Wednesday that they were in talks with the government on a long-term plan to rejuvenate their workforce.\nBut the companies did not confirm a newspaper report they were seeking approval for a five-year plan to cut 40,000 jobs in an early retirement scheme in exchange for hiring 14,000 young people. Newspaper Les Echos said the cost of these operations could be 30 billion francs ($6 billion).\n"Our chairman Louis Schweitzer and Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet have written a letter to Prime Minister Alain Juppe in July with a proposal," a Renault spokeswoman said.\n"There have been discussions since but the government has not yet replied," she added.\nAt Peugeot, officials declined to comment on the existence of the letter but a spokesman said that the French car industry needed to rejuvenate its work force.\n"In France, the average age of a car worker is 42 to 43 years but our competitors, especially Asian, have an average age of below 30 years," the Peugeot spokesman said.\nHe said that this gave Peugeot and Renault a competitive handicap at a time when the markets are increasingly being opened up -- from 1999 a quota system limiting Japanese car imports in Europe will be lifted.\nYounger workers are not only cheaper but also more flexible and open to new techniques such as "empowerment" - a management idea giving workers more responsibility for their own work, the Peugeot official said.\nAt Renault the average age is 45 years. "We have old factories, the oldest is at Flins which dates from the war, and therefore the average age is rather high," the Renault spokeswoman said.\nRenault had a worldwide staff of 139,950 people at the end of 1995. Of them, 72,163 were involved in car production in France.\nAt PSA Peugeot Citroen, the group number is 139,900 of whom 122,600 are in car production in France.\nFrench car makers are experiencing difficulties and a two-year government old-for-new car incentive scheme has not helped to overcome market problems.\n($1=5.057 French Franc)\n'

a(S'Australian paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd is expected on Monday to post a heavy slump in annual profit, due to lower paper prices and weak demand in its home market, but analysts feel the worst may soon be over.\nThe group, which recently warned the stock market its 1995/96 (July/June) results would be down on its 1994/95 record net profit, is tipped to announce a fall of around eight percent in pre-abnormal net earnings.  \nStock analysts are forecasting on average a result of A$372 million pre-abnormal profit in 1995/96, according to BZW Investment Management\'s BARCEPS forecasting service.\nBut Amcor, which is highly sensitive to both world paper prices and the Australian economic cycle, is coming off a record year in 1994/95, when a surge in paper prices and a strong local economy lifted the bottom line by 40 percent to A$359.7 million.\nIn the first half of 1995/96, prices turned against the group, which relies for 45 percent of its turnover on white paper sales, and the domestic economy has remained flat.  \nPrices have fallen in the order of about 30 percent since their peak in late calendar 1995, one paper market source said.\nIn a sign of the times, Amcor\'s 46-percent-owned paper merchant Spicers Paper Ltd reported last Monday a 35 percent slide in annual net profit to A$16.02 million.\n"There\'s been some pretty tough markets there and I think the Australian economy is flat and the paper cycle has gone against them a bit," said Brisbane-based analyst John Clifford, of Morgan Stockbroking Ltd.  \nSales are expected to exceed last year\'s A$6.6 billion, but margins have been squeezed and are likely to remain tight through at least the first half of 1996/97, the analysts said.\nBut Clifford and a Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters they saw pre-abnormal net profit stabilising at around A$400 million in 1996/97 and recovering the next year.\n"As soon as there is some sort of pick-up in economic growth, you will see it start to improve," the Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters on Thursday.\n"I am positive in the longer term," she added.  \nAmcor, one of the world\'s top ten paper and packaging groups, has paper packaging operations in Europe, the United States, Asia and New Zealand. It has maintained double-digit growth in net profit for all but four of the past five years.\nDespite the current downturn, it has continued to expand its offshore operations, buying 51 percent of Belgian UCB SA\'s flexible packing unit in May for about A$200 million.\nIt has also allocated A$380 million to expand paper production in Australia, where it commands about 40 percent of the market for fine papers.  \nMorgan\'s Clifford said he believed these and other capital investments -- totalling A$1.5 billion over the past two and a half years -- would begin to bolster the bottom line in 1997/98.\n"These sorts of programmes will certainly come through with increased profits through 1998 (1997/98) and especially through 1999 (1998/99)," Clifford said.\n"The four to five-year outlook is pretty strong," he added.\n-- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421\n'

a(S'A former chief executive of Australian retail giant Coles Myer Ltd spent millions of dollars of the company\'s money to renovate his home in a case of 1980s greed and excess, a court heard on Monday.\nBrian Quinn, 60, who rose from a junior store assistant to run the country\'s biggest retailer, went on trial on Monday in the Victoria Supreme Court on a charge of conspiracy to defraud.\nQuinn has pleaded not guilty and suggests he was set up.\nThe prosecution said on Monday that Quinn conspired to spend around A$4.0 million (US$3.0 million) of the group\'s money on renovations to his Melbourne home from 1982 to 1988, expanding and renovating it and building a tennis court, spa and pergola.\nProsecutor Paul Coghlan accused Quinn of excess, saying one room was painted 10 times, the house was extended by 70 square metres (80 square yards) and the land was levelled using a rock crusher and surrounded by a double-brick fence.\n"This is a case...about excess in money wasting, excess as to how much work was down, excess as to the materials used, excess as to the hours spent," Coghlan told the jury.\n"But most of all it\'s a case about greed. It\'s a case about having your employer paying for your excesses," he added.\nThe prosecution said Quinn and another former Coles manager, Graham Lanyon, conspired to ensure Coles paid the bills by pretending the work was being done on stores owned by Coles.\n"The expenses were largely concealed from his employer, who was meeting the cost," Coghlan said.\nLanyon, as chief of the company\'s maintenance department, falsified invoices to conceal the fraud but "he did so in collusion with, or on the orders of, the accused man", he added.\nBut defence lawyer Philip Dunn said Quinn was the victim of a corrupt maintenance department headed by Lanyon and corrupt works contractors. Both concealed costs from Quinn who agreed in 1988 to partly reimburse the company, he told the jury.\n"He is as much a victim as the company is," Dunn said.\nQuinn\'s home belonged to Coles until 1985, when he bought it for what prosecutors estimate was about half market value. Prosecutors said that even while Coles owned the house, the work was done without board approval.\n"Brian Quinn is charged with stealing from his employer whilst he was living in a company house, which indicates how much of a nonsense and a load of rubbish we believe this case is," Dunn told the jury.\nThe trial is expected to last eight weeks.\n'

a(S'The world\'s biggest mining house, RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, is set to report a sharp fall in annual profit this week after shouldering a slide in metal prices during the year and battling problems with its U.S. copper smelter, mining analysts said.\nThe group, which has operations spanning the globe, is on average expected to post a 26-percent fall in net profit before exceptional items to US$1.067 billion for calendar 1996, a Reuter survey of six Australian brokerages revealed.\nRTZ-CRA, a dual-listed merger of British-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, is due to announce its earnings on Thursday. It made US$1.441 billion in 1995.\nAustralian analysts\' forecasts range between US$1.04 billion and US$1.097 billion, although private forecasting service Barceps quoted much lower numbers in a survey last month.\nThe culprits behind RTZ-CRA\'s profit slump are seen as the copper price, which dipped below 90 U.S. cents a pound after the Sumitomo trading scandal erupted in June, a weak aluminium price and problems with the flagship Bingham Canyon copper smelter.\nTogether, copper and aluminium earned almost 41 percent of RTZ-CRA\'s total revenue in 1995, and metal prices were promising enough early in 1996 for the group to talk of higher earnings.\nBut metal prices caught a cold and the prospects of improved profits also began to look sick mid-year, when the Sumitomo Corp trading scandal sent international copper prices crashing.\nYasuo Hamanaka, a star trader who once dominated the copper market, has admitted charges of fraud and forgery and accepted blame for a scandal that cost Sumitomo $2.6 billion and devalued the copper inventories of metals companies around the world.\n"Everything peaked ahead of this Hamanaka copper thing," said Peter O\'Connor of Macquarie Bank.\n"Most commodities slid from June on through to about September, October and there\'s been a bit of recovery in most metal prices since that time."\nRTZ-CRA\'s iron ore business was also a disappointment, one analyst said, noting that sales for the year dropped six percent despite a lift in annual output.\nAdding salt to the wound, the gold price also languished. Gold is a sensitive area for the mining giant, since it is fundamentally opposed to selling its production forward at a fixed price to lock in revenue.\nRTZ-CRA\'s coal mines are also not expected to have relieved some of the pain inflicted on the group by weak prices. One analyst expects coal earnings to fall 10 percent in 1996.\nRTZ-CRA\'s troubled Bingham Canyon smelter in Utah has stirred the deepest concerns among analysts, who have been waiting for the new plant to get it right after 18 months of hobbled operation. The smelter is still not operating at full capacity and soon faces a six-week shut-down soon for major modifications.\nCopper division earnings are forecast to plunge by some 40 percent, according to HSBC James Capel\'s forecast.\nStill, the brokerage likes the group\'s long-term prospects, which include a copper mine in Chile and a copper and gold mine in Indonesia.\n"They have a very, very strong organic growth profile," said HSBC James Capel analyst Umit Safak. "They have very substantial expansions coming up," he added.\n'

a(S'Australian casino company Crown Ltd said on Tuesday its earnings were likely to suffer due to lost time at its new casino complex in Melbourne.\nCrown, which has seen its share price fall as doubts emerge over its profit outlook, confirmed that a recent heatwave forced workers at the site to down tools for a number of days.\n"I don\'t think we have made a calculation yet on what effect it will have on the bottom line, but it\'s something you don\'t need in this part of the project," Crown spokesman Gary O\'Neill said. "I think it will (impact profit)," he added.  \nCrown had planned to open its new A$1.6 billion casino, hotel and shopping complex in Melbourne in March. It is now aiming for late April and maybe even May, O\'Neill told Reuters.\n"We are still hoping to open towards the end of April...but things like this don\'t help obviously and it could have a small effect on the bottom line. It could put the open date back to May," he said.\nO\'Neill was commenting on a newspaper report which said members of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) stopped work 10 times this month as the temperature topped 35 degrees Celcius.  \n"There were 10 days when the temperature was over 35 degrees, but I don\'t think we lost all of that time," O\'Neill said. "I think we lost a number of working days."\nCrown also rejected a bearish earnings forecast made by accountants Ernst and Young.\nThe forecast was cited in an  independent report sent to Crown shareholders recently.\nIt quotes Ernst and Young as forecasting basic earnings per share of 3.76 cents in 1997/98 (July-June), compared with brokers\' average forecast of 14.8 cents for the same year.  \nThe brokers\' forecast was based on a mean pre-abnormal net profit of A$87.5 million for 1997/98, according to Barceps forecasting service. Crown reported net profit after abnormals of A$58.38 million in 1995/96.\n"We obviously don\'t agree with it (the Ernst and Young forecast)," O\'Neill said.\n"Right at the moment, it\'s a very highly speculative period of time. It\'s just prior to our opening and people are tending to jump at shadows a little bit," he added.  \nCrown\'s share price has fallen steeply over the past month. It stood at A$2.45 at 0300 GMT (2.00 p.m.) on Tuesday, down from its closing high so far this year of A$2.76 on January 22 and its 12 month high at A$3.06.\nCrown is owned 30.9 percent by Hudson Conway Ltd, the operator of Crown casino at its existing premises. Hudson Conway also has options to buy 74.5 million new shares in Crown.\nCrown is currently negotiating to buy back the casino management rights from Hudson Conway.\n-- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421\n'

a(S'Microsoft Corp. reported better-than-expected profits for the latest quarter Monday as strong demand for its Windows operating systems and applications helped fuel record sales.\nThe computer software giant said earnings rose 23 percent to a record $614 million, or 95 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, from $499 million, or 78 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues jumped 14 percent to $2.30 billion from $2.02 billion.\nThe profits, announced after the market closed, exceeded the Wall Street consensus expectation of 90 cents a share, and Microsoft shares rose to $136.375 in after-hours trading from the earlier close of $134 on Nasdaq.\nTreasurer Greg Maffei said the 14 percent revenue increase was the smallest ever posted in the company\'s 21-year history, reflecting a surge in sales last year when Microsoft launched its Windows 95 operating system.\nBut with the high sales, marketing and manufacturing costs of Windows 95 also behind it, the company\'s operating profit margin surged to a record 39.3 percent of revenues, compared with about 35.1 percent a year earlier, said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.\n"It looks like it was just a great quarter, and there\'s more to come," he said.\nMicrosoft executives said in a conference call with analysts that business would continue to be boosted by an expected holiday surge in sales of personal computers and the December release of Office 97, an update to the company\'s business applications product.\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said he expected revenues to rise sequentially over the next two quarters and indicated revenue for the current quarter could be in the range of $2.4 billion, about 12 percent over last year\'s levels.\nBut he said the company\'s cost of goods sold should remain at about 11 percent of sales, compared with 15 percent in last year\'s second quarter.\n"I\'m very happy with the general revenue trend, and I was very pleased with the pattern of costs in the quarter," Brown said in an interview.\nMicrosoft also cited strong acceptance of the company\'s high end Windows NT operating system.\nMaffei said sales of the NT workstation were up 400 percent over year-ago levels, while revenues from the BackOffice suite of server products doubled. Officials declined to give figures, but the BackOffice line currently generates about $1 billion in annual revenue.\nMicrosoft\'s overall revenues are about evenly divided between operating systems -- most of which are shipped loaded on new computers -- and applications.\nExcluding sales directly to manufacturers, European revenues were flat in the quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and revenues in the United States and Europe rose 9 percent, reflecting the tough comparison.\nBut revenues from other markets such as Japan, where Windows 95 was not released until later, were up 32 percent, Microsoft said.\nOverall last year Microsoft revenues and profits grew 46 percent, driven largely by the Windows 95 launch.\nBrown also said the company was on track to spend $2.1 billion on research and development in the current fiscal year, including such ventures as its MSNBC cable and Internet news venture with NBC.\nAnd the "unearned revenue" in the company\'s balance sheet from cyclical products such as Windows grew to $651 million as of Sept. 30 from $560 million three months earlier.\nThe company\'s cash hoard grew slightly to $7.1 billion from $6.94 billion.\n'

a(S'After months of denying that a $500 Internet appliance would pose a threat to its industry dominance, Microsoft Corp. plans to announce a new push for inexpensive, easy-to-use personal computers.\nMicrosoft is working with Intel Corp. and major compouter manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. on the intiative and will announce details at a conference Monday, said a spokesman for the software giant, confirming a published report.\nThe announcement will come one day before the widely anticipated unveiling of an $800 device from Microsoft rival Sun Microsystems Inc.\nThe Sun product is among the first of an expected flurry of appliance-like devices dubbed network computers being positioned as Internet-friendly alternatives to PCs based on the "Wintel" standard of Microsoft Windows and Intel processors.\nWhile Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other executives have downplayed the threat from network computers, they have been scrambling to come up with ways to make personal computers easier to use for home consumers and cheaper to maintain for businesses.\n"They and Intel have certainly heard the network computer mantra and have discovered a new religion," said Rob Enderle, an industry analyst with Giga Information Group.\n"The threat is very real," he said. "Particularly for the (corporate) community, the concern surrounding the cost of managing multiple Wintel systems has been driving them to consider other alternatives."\nAt the same time personal computer penetration into the home appears to be hitting a plateau far short of other mass-market electronic devices.\nIn a report early this year that set off alarm bells throughout the industry, Dataquest forecast sharply slowing growth. The research group predicted PCs would be in 38 percent of U.S. homes by 1999, compared with 29 percent last year.\nBut since Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison and other executives began publicizing the network computer a little over a year ago, Microsoft officials routinely have minimized its importance.\n"We dont think it\'s likely that Internet appliances, network computers or whatever you call them are going to displace the PC anytime soon," Gates told a Harvard University audience in May.\nAt the same time Microsoft has been stepping up efforts to make the PC easier to use, acknowledging the machines are dauntingly complex for many consumers.\nIn April Gates unveiled a set of technologies for what Microsoft called the "Simply Interactive PC," which he said would make the personal computer "as easy and convenient to use as other home appliances."\nMonday\'s announcement apparently will go further to bring consumers lower prices, which are being made possible by falling prices of memory and other components.\n"They\'re validating the proposition we\'ve been taking to the market for the last year," said Jon Kannegaard, vice president of software products for Sun\'s JavaSoft unit.\nJesse Berst, executive editor of Windows Watcher, an industry newsletter, agreed that Microsoft was late to acknowledge the importance of network computers.\n"They\'re awful late to respond to what has been a very, very strong message from customers," he said.\n"If they had been doing what they should have been doing, which is really driving down prices aggressively, they wouldn\'t have been in the position where someone has the opportunity to come and take their franchise away."\n'

a(S'An outbreak of bacterial food poisoning that sickened at least 13 children and young adults in the Seattle area has been traced to one company\'s tainted apple juice, health officials said on Wednesday.\nOdwalla Inc, a rapidly growing fresh juice and beverage company based in Half Moon Bay, California, issued a nationwide recall of products containing fresh apple juice, and many retailers pulled all Odwalla beverages from their shelves.\nState and county health officials said 10 of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli food poisoning had been conclusively traced to the unpasteurized Odwalla juice and the remaining three were under investigation.\nAt least eight more suspected cases have been reported, Dr. Mimi Fields, the state\'s deputy health secretary, said.\n"It\'s difficult to know where we are on the epidenmic curve, although I don\'t think we are going to see a large influx of masses of new cases," Fields told Reuters.\nThe outbreak was the state\'s worst since some 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died in 1993 after eating undercooked hamburgers.\nWhile adults may suffer diarrhea, stomach cramps or more mild, flulike symptoms after eating food tainted by the bacterium, young children are more susceptible to the disease and may suffer sudden kidney failure that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.\nIn the current outbreak, six children have been hospitalized, including two who required dialysis. Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.\nThe strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or   fertilizer\nthat includes steer manure.\nHealth officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla\'s plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.\n"Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected," Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.\nAlthough so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.\nOdwalla, which bills itself as the "leading branded fresh juice and beverage company," distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.\nIn the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million. But net income fell to $633,000, or 12 cents a share, from $997,000, or 22 cents a share.\n'

a(S'Federal officials Sunday confirmed 29 cases of bacterial poisoning linked to fresh apple juice as investigators tested for contamination in samples pulled from Western U.S. and Canadian store shelves.\nBob Howard of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said the agency had confirmed that 29 children and young adults had been infected with a potentially fatal strain of the E. coli bacterium after drinking Odwalla Inc. fruit juice in California, Washington, Colorado and the Vancouver area of British Columbia.\nAt least 36 additional cases are suspected or under investigation, state, county and provincial officials said.\nState and federal officials continued to test Odwalla juice samples over the weekend but said they had not found any evidence of contamination.\n"We\'re going to have to wait a few days to know for sure whether the samples are negative or positive," Arthur Whitmore of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. "It is quite possible we won\'t actually find anything, but we have a good selection of samples, including those from the company\'s library of samples."\nOdwalla, a rapidly growing juice company based in Half Moon Bay, California, was able to provide samples from production runs of two weeks ago, when the first cases surfaced in the Seattle area.\nWhitmore said he did not know of any cases in which illness set in after Oct. 23, although the disease can incubate for up to two weeks.\nAt least four children remained hospitalized because of complications caused by the E. coli O57:H7 bacterium, including a 2-year-old girl in critical condition in California. Tara Azizi was in critical condition "but improving slightly," Stephen Texeira of Children\'s Hospital in Oakland said.\nYoung children are most susceptible to the bacterium, which causes stomach cramps followed by bloody diarrhea. In severe cases the illness can lead to kidney failure, which is treated through dialysis but may cause brain damage and death.\nThe bacterium, which normally lives in the digestive system of cattle, can enter the food chain through fecal contamination, because of either improper slaughtering or contact with manure.\nHealth officials speculated that Odwalla may have used apples that had fallen onto the ground, although company officials say they do not use "ground apples" and all produce is thoroughly washed before processing at the company\'s Dinuba, California, plant.\nOdwalla juices are not pasteurized. Heat processing kills bacteria but can also alter flavor.\nThe outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 is the biggest in the United States since 1993 when more than 500 people fell ill in the Pacific Northwest and three children died after eating tainted meat, mostly at Jack-In-The-Box hamburger restaurants.\nThe same strain of E. coli sickened 9,500 people and killed 11 in Japan last summer. No source was identified in that outbreak, though raw radish shoots were suspected.\nThe CDC\'s Howard said the agency recommended that people boil unpasteurized cider or juice.\n'

a(S'Boeing Co. is expected to use the biennial Farnborough Air Show in England next week to formally launch the long-awaited stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet, industry analysts say.\nWhile officials of the aerospace giant remain tight-lipped, analysts say it is all but certain executives will make a major announcement on Monday regarding two new members of the 747 family that will be known as the 747-500 and 747-600.\n"They\'re going to announce the airplanes -- there is no doubt," said Joe Campbell, an analyst at Lehman Bros.\nHe said the only question was whether Boeing would announce massive orders of $10 billion or more from launch customers or merely disclose that its board of directors had given authorization to offer the jet.\nThe announcement of the new models, which would include a jet with 30 percent more capacity than today\'s largest commercial airliner, is expected to be the highlight of the air show, frequently the stage for major order announcements and other industry news.\nBoeing officials have said they are talking with at least six airlines about the potential new versions of the jumbo jet, including British Airways Plc, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and UAL Corp.\'s United Airlines.\nBoeing President Phil Condit said the company\'s board of directors discussed the new plane at a regularly scheduled meeting Monday but had not made a decision on whether to launch it.\n"That will depend on airline orders," he said in a brief interview Tuesday.\nSpecifications being circulated within the industry call for the 747-600 to hold 548 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of up to 8,900 miles (14,300 km), compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles (13,500 km) for the current-generation 747-400.\nThe long-range 747-500 would hold 462 passengers in three classes and have a range of up to 10,000 miles (16,000 km).\nAnalysts say the 747 stretch is essential for Boeing to continue dominating the lucrative top end of the market -- which it has had to itself since the introduction of the four-engine jumbo jet in 1970, which nearly bankrupted the company.\nNow Boeing\'s own new 777 twin-engine jet is replacing older 747s, and possible new versions of jets from rivals Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. could threaten the lower end of the jumbo market.\n"They really do need to be able to move up to again have a position of complete monopoly for the aircraft as they have had for a number of years," said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.\nMeanwhile Airbus has signaled that it intends to go ahead with plans for its own all-new 550-seat plane, dubbed the 3XX, although analysts question whether the market for jumbo jets is big enough for two manufacturers.\n"From an economic point of view, I don\'t think there\'s enough demand to justify the $10 (billion) to $15 billion cost" of an all-new jet, said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.\nHe and other analysts said they expect air travel in the fast-growing Pacific region to follow the Atlantic in migrating to pairs of smaller cities rather than routes between world capitals that require the largest jets.\nThe trend toward such more thinly traveled routes was among the reasons cited by Boeing when it shelved a project to jointly develop with Airbus a double-decker airliner that would hold up to 800 passengers.\nBut Lehman\'s Campbell predicted Europe\'s Airbus, which is transforming itself from a consortium into a single company, would go ahead with its own jumbo jet for commercial delivery in 2003, about three years after Boeing\'s new 747 models.\n"They\'re not going to leave Boeing alone at the upper end," he said.\nCampbell estimated that Boeing\'s 747 revision, which would include a new wing, new engines and possible new cockpit electronics, would cost from $5 billion to $8 billion to develop.\nRolls-Royce Plc has said it plans to offer a variant of its Trent turbofan engine to power the new Boeing craft, while rivals General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.\'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit have formed a joint venture to develop an alternative power plant.\n'

a(S'Upscale apparel retailer Nordstrom Inc. Monday posted a 16 percent increase in earnings for its third quarter as it boosted sales and reduced markdowns.\nFor the fiscal third quarter ending Oct. 31, Nordstrom posted sales of $984 million, up 9 percent over last year\'s $907 million. Net income rose to $34 million, or 42 cents a share, from $29 million, or 36 cents a share, last year.\nWhen certain one-time gains and costs were excluded, the company earned about 38 cents a share, compared with a Wall Street consensus forecast of 36 cents, said Piper Jaffray analyst Saul Yaari.\nHe and other analysts said they expected to raise their estimates.\n"It was a great quarter," said Jennifer Black Groves of Black &amp; Co. in Portland, Ore.\nShe noted the company had a difficult summer because of an over-reliance on unpopular body-hugging fashions and a merchandise reconfiguration that confused customers and sales executives.\nThe result was heavy markdowns in July and August that ate into earnings, but company executives said the deepest of the markdowns appear to be behind them.\n"They sacrificed the short term for what will be very beenficial for them in the long term," Groves said.\nShe said the merchandise reconfiguration, aimed at bringing the company\'s clothing selections more into line with its customer base, has "rejuvenated the company."\n"I think you\'re going to see some great numbers in the year ahead," she said.\nNordstrom said comparable-store sales, a closely watched measure of industry performance, fell 0.3 percent in the latest quarter but were up 1.5 percent for the year to date.\nAnd executives told analysts in a conference call that their plans called for comparable-store sales to rise at least 2 percent in the critical holiday quarter compared with a relatively weak 1995 period.\n"We have plenty of ability to respond to sales above that," Nordstrom co-Chairman John Whitacre said in the conference call.\nComparable-store sales are adjusted to represent only that retail space that has been open at least a year.\nNordstrom has opened several new stores this year and plans to open three new department stores and several smaller stores next year, adding about 719,000 square feet of store space to its current total of 11.74 million, executives said.\n'

a(S'American Airlines is planning to place a long-awaited order for about $6 billion worth of Boeing Co. airplanes, according to reports published Wednesday.\nAirline Chairman Robert Crandall was scheduled to make a "major company announcement" at a news conference Thursday.\nOfficials of Boeing and American declined to comment on the order, reported in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, although an airline spokesman confirmed that directors of its parent company, AMR Corp., were meeting.\nAccording to the reports, American will announce an order for more than 100 new Boeing jets, including 12 wide-body 777s and 75 narrow-body 737s.\nAlthough American officials have said privately they have chosen Boeing for their fleet modernisation programme, the exact size of the initial order has not been revealed.\nThe orders are expected to be contingent on ratification by pilots of a new six-year contract, which could be put to a vote next month. The board of the pilots union was voting Wednesday on a tentative labour pact reached in September.\nIndustry analysts saw the order as a signal American could order hundreds of Boeing jets over the next two decades as it updates and expands its fleet, now a mix of planes built by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp., Airbus Industrie and Fokker NV.\n"I think basically this is a commitment to the Boeing family," analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities said.\n"If you look at their fleet, they (American) have kind of a hodgepodge of things," he said. "I think you can make the case that most of the airplanes they will be buying in the future will be these Boeing models."\nAmerican currently does not operate the 737, which seats from 108 to 189 passengers and initially will be used to replace the 75 older 727 jets used by the airline.\nBut analysts said that over the next decade American likely will buy more 737s to replace its fleet of 260 ageing McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.\nAmerican already has announced plans to sell most of its wide-body MD-11 jets to Federal Express Corp. for use as cargo jets, and analysts said Boeing\'s 777 would be a likely replacement choice suitable for the carrier\'s potential expansion in the Far East.\nAnalyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said American, the nation\'s No. 1 airline by revenue, appears to be turning over "the whole fleet to Boeing aircraft."\n"It\'s a huge fleet," he said. "Over the next decade there\'s going to be a lot more than $6 billion in planes delivered."\nFor beleaguered McDonnell Douglas Corp., the decision would be yet another blow for a company that has acknowledged it will be only a niche player in the commercial aircraft market and last week was knocked out of contention for the Pentagon\'s biggest weapons programme of the early 21st century, a jet fighter.\nAnalysts said they still expect a big fleet-renewal order from No. 3 carrier Delta Air Lines Inc., which could go at least partly to McDonnell Douglas.\n"Somewhere along the line this is going to bubble over in McDonell Douglas\' favour," Nisbet said.\nOther major U.S. carriers already have announced their intentions to buy new airplanes now that the industry has returned to financial health after a long downturn.\nEarlier this month, USAir Group Inc. chose Europe\'s Airbus Industrie to supply it with narrow-body jets in an order that could be worth $18 billion over the next 13 years. The carrier is negotiating with Boeing and Airbus for new wide-body jets.\nBoeing stock rose $2.375 to $96.375 Wednesday and AMR stock was off 62.5 cents at $91, both on the New York Stock Exchange.\n'

a(S'Microsoft Corp. is expected to report modest earnings growth for the latest quarter Friday despite tough comparisons with the year-earlier period and a sales slowdown ahead of an upgrade of a popular software package.\nIndustry analysts surveyed by First Call on average expect Microsoft to report earnings of 51 cents a share for its second quarter ended on Dec. 31, up about 16 percent from the 44 cents a share reported a year earlier. Sales are expected to rise about 14 percent to more than $2.5 billion.\nAnalysts consider that a strong performance against tough comparisons with the year-earlier period, the first full quarter of availability for the Windows 95 operating system.\nIn the 1995 second quarter sales soared 54 percent and net income jumped 48 percent.\n"These guys are just incredibly strong now," said Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. "They\'ll probably meet or beat (Wall) Street\'s estimate again."\nInvestors will have all weekend to analyse the results, which are due to be released after the close of trading Friday.\nMicrosoft executives originally had scheduled the release for Thursday but decided to delay the report until a day after an event publicising the launch of Office 97, its best-selling package of business software.\nAnalysts estimated that revenues of Office and its component applications account for up to 30 percent of Microsoft\'s total, but the figure will be lower for the quarter just ended because of the impending upgrade.\nFor much of the quarter Microsoft offered Office 95 buyers coupons good for a free upgrade, which will result in some revenues being deferred into future reporting periods.\nBut strong growth in personal computer sales and in acceptance of Microsoft\'s high-end Windows NT operating system continue to buoy the company\'s profits.\n"The ongoing strength of the NT cycle is what\'s carrying the day," said Chris Galvin of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "Countervailing that is the tough comparison last year with the Windows 95 release, so it\'s a mixed scenario."\nOwen said that while sales of PCs to consumers were sluggish in the latest quarter, declining prices and increased processing power had sparked a new wave of corporate buying.\nHe said 30 percent or fewer of corporate desktops have made the transition to the Windows 95 or Windows NT systems.\n"That\'s a tremendous opportunity for Microsoft," he said.\n'

a(S'Microsoft Corp\'s share price rose to recored levels Monday despite a warnings by the software giant of slowing growth in fiscal 1998.\nMicrosoft, which reported "blowout" second quarter results on Friday, was up 4-3/4 at 91-7/8 and sparked a broad rally on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue with nearly 15 million shares changing hands.\nAfter the market closed Friday the company reported second-quarter earnings of $0.57 a share, up from $0.45 a year earlier and easily surpassing a consensus estimate of $0.51.  \n"They had a great quarter," said Frank Michnoff of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "(And) the outlook for the next two quarters looks very good; they said so themselves -- uncharacteristically."\nMore characteristic were comments by Microsoft executives in the earnings statement and a conference call with analysts afterward: They warned of a slowdown in growth in fiscal 1998, which begins July 1.\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown even went so far as to question the high valuation of the company\'s stock.  \nIn a comment worthy of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Brown said Microsoft\'s high price-to-earnings multiple was a "cause for curiosity."\nBut while Piper Jaffray downgraded the stock to hold from buy, based on its 100 percent increase over the past year, few investors heeded the warning.\n"They do that every year," Michnoff said, referring to Microsoft\'s conservative forecasts. "It\'s a bit like the boy who cried wolf. People are just not believing it."\nMost analysts who follow Microsoft raised their earnings estimates for the company.  \nFirst Call, which tracks estimates, said a consensus of 19 analysts surveyed today was that the Redmond, Wash.-based company would earn $2.33 a share for fiscal 1997, ending June 30, up from a previous consensus was $2.07. The company earned $1.72 a share in fiscal 1996.\nFor fiscal 1998, analysts now see the company earning $2.71 a share, up from a previous consensus of $2.48.\nAnalysts say fiscal 1998 will be a year of tough comparisons for Microsoft after the 1995 introduction of the Windows 95 operating system, last year\'s upgrade of Windows NT, and this year\'s launch of the Office 97 application upgrade.  \nWhile Microsoft plans an upgrade to Windows 95 more tightly integrated to its Internet browser, it is unlikely to derive the benefits of another price increase or significant further operating cost reductions, analysts said.\n"I think that Microsoft does have a lot of hurdles to get over," said Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities, who calls the stock "fairly valued" at its current level of more than 30 times fiscal 1998 earnings.\nBut analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie said investors are happy to pay a premium for a company that dominates one of the biggest growth industries and consistently surpasses Wall Street expectations.\n"They\'ve delivered consistent earnings, and Wall Street hates ugly surprises," he said.\nAnalyst David Readerman of Montgomery Securities said Microsoft would like to slow the meteoric rise in its stock price, if only to meet the challenge of providing enough shares to fulfill employee stock options.\n"Yet it\'s difficult, with such a compelling long-term growth story, to keep a great stock down," he said in a published comment.\n((-- Seattle Bureau 206-386-4848))\n'

a(S'A prolonged dry spell In Ivory Coast has stretched into the small rainy season, but its impact on mid-crop cocoa pod setting and main crop growth may not be clearer until later this year, crop and weather analysts said on Wednesday.\n"The weather is very, very strange. We have a mixture of harmattan (hot, dry) conditions in some places but light rains nearby," said one crop analyst. "Pod setting and progression could be affected. It just depends on rains before December as the front passes," he added.\nWeather analysts said the front that usually heads southwards in September, giving Ivory coast a light rainy season between September and December, had finally moved south over the weekend. But rains were still far below average.\n"It is now over Dimbokro (seventh northern parallel) but rains are well over a month late. So far we have not had a small rainy season," said one weather analyst.\nWeather data showed less than 50 percent of average October rains fell in Ivory Coast. Data for early November were not available to build a clear picture of the overall rainfall pattern in early November, said analysts.\n"Flowering and soil moisture vary greatly between regions but cherelle (early pod) setting should be clearer later in November," said a crop analyst who recently toured Ivorian farms.\nUp-country buyers around Daloa told Reuters intermittent rains had started in the centre-west cocoa region but more rain was needed for late main and early mid-crop development.\nIvory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season late on October 24 after rain deluges in July and August. Bean moisture was no longer a problem, they said.\n"Now there is a nice mixture of rain and sun but we need more rain up to the end of the year to avoid small mid-crop bean sizes," said one buyer. Beans sizes of over 110 per 100 grammes are not considered to be of export quality.\nCrop analysts said soil moisture levels were low in some areas and could affect pod sizes if sunny weather continued. One crop analyst told Reuters he had only seen rain on two out of his 10 days of treking around the whole cocoa belt.\nOfficial weather data showed average or above rains in Man and Gagnoa, but rain deficits elsewhere, particularly south of Gagnoa, around Sassandra, Abidjan and Adiake.\nSunny conditions had prevailed in the south as monsoon air was at higher altitudes south of Gagnoa than usual, said the weather analyst.\n"The sun is burning off low clouds," he said.\nElsewhere, one crop analyst said the danger in Ghana of blackpod, a fungus hitting cocoa pods in prolonged cool and damp spells, had gone after regional attacks in September. Rains there had been heavier than in Ivory Coast.\n--Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90\n'

a(S'Sporadic rain showers up to the end of November have continued to water Ivory Coast\'s cocoa belt but mid-crop campaign prospects are not yet clear, say weather and crop analysts.\nA weather front expected to bring hot dry weather southwards over the whole of Ivory Coast had backtracked to the country\'s northern border with light rains taking hold in dried out areas.\n"It has moved up to Korhogo (10th northern parallel) from Dimbokro (8th)," said one weather analyst. Rains usually fall in a sweep 200 km to the south of the front\'s position, he added.\nCrop analysts said the front\'s retreat meant no dramatic changes in cocoa pod development but they welcomed continuing rains.\n"We are now seeing the first fruits for the mid-crop ," said one crop analyst. "December weather will now determine the full potential. It is too early too draw conclusions," he addded.\nWeather data show variable rains for the last 10 days of November with 650 percent of normal levels falling around Bondoukou in the north-east, put down to local effects, compared to 53 percent for San Pedro and Tabou in the southwest.\nAn average of 30mm fell at ten weather stations monitored in the last ten days of November with heavy showers concentrated around Abidjan and Yamassoukro. In the preceeding ten days the average was 42mm, also boosted by heavy showers in Abidjan.\nOverall November rains in three successive ten day periods rose from 104mm to 423mm before dropping to 295 mm in the last third of the month.\nLight rains fell in Daloa and Man, after none in the first ten days of November. More southern cocoa belt areas received 53 percent of end-November average rains around San Pedro, and 62 percent around Gagnoa. Rains around Abidjan and Yamassoukro were 200 percent above average.\n"November rains moved into surplus in the south towards the end of the month but we are still in deficit in the north," said a weather analyst.\nCrop analysts said the latest weather picture was highly variable and mid-crop development would depend on December\'s pattern. Rains last year continued into December, they said.\n"This year, dry weather up to early November slowed down mid-crop development but we could still be heading towards a reasonable crop," said the crop analyst.\n"It is too early to draw conclusions as last year\'s weather picture was different," he said.  "We had twice the normal rains for December but then a strong mid-crop."\nOne crop analyst said on November 20 a long dry spell pushing into the year\'s short rainy season could slightly affect young cocoa fruits. The degree would depend on an extension rains seen since early November which would cushion the drying effect of Harmattan conditions, he said then.\nUp-country buyers welcomed rains after dry weather in September and October but said drying problems had increased harvested cocoa humidity levels to up to 10 percent.\n"Drying has slowed deliveries a bit, but overall quality is still good," said one.\nAbidjan newsroom +225 21 90 90\n'

Christian and Moslem differences have calmed although Islamic fundamentalism is rising," one diplomat told Reuters.\nPolls open from 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) to 6 p.m. (1700 GMT).\nFrench troops, stationed in Chad under a defence pact, will help fly voting materials and the 30 international observers to far-flung polling stations.\nPresident Idriss Deby, the former northern guerrilla leader who seized power in a French-backed coup in 1990, won a long-delayed presidential election in July against southern rival and fellow general Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue.\nDeby\'s Patriotic Salvation Movement, leading member of the 27-party Republican Front coalition, starts favourite to win Sunday\'s election or to be able to cobble together a working majority after the poll.\nElection officials expect vote counting to end by Wednesday, provisional results a week later and final results by January 25, once the appeal court has checked them. Any run-offs will be held on February 23.\nMany opposition parties disputed the first-round results of the presidential poll and urged their supporters to boycott the runoff but polling passed off peacefully. The opposition are grouped in a 17-party coalition.\nThe capital was calm on Saturday following a peaceful campaign, which ended on December 31.\nElection issues tended to be local or ethnic but diplomats said that all parties were looking for a fair distribution of any wealth from oil, which is expected to come on stream by the year 2000. Chad has about 100 ethnic groups.\n"People still largely vote on local grounds and Deby is not president of all Chadians," former national assembly leader, Jean Alingue, another defeated presidential hopeful, told Reuters.\n"Turnout will be low because people know the fraud apparatus is still in place and nothing much will change," he predicted.\nChad has known coups, civil war or conflict with northern neighbour Libya for much of its life from independence in 1960.\nIt had a 57-member interim legislature under a 1993 transitional charter.

a(S'Ivory Coast\'s 1996/97 coffee is likely to be well up on last season but rising volumes are bringing quality problems, regional buyers and exporters\' agents said.\nThey expect coffee marketing, sluggish for the time of year, to pick up in February.\n"There\'s a lot of coffee about but quality is poor," said one buyer based in the Man region. "We could see well over 230,000 tonnes but exporters have bought little so far and made large quality adjustments."\nPort forwarding agents said they had noted no major quality problems with coffee received for export. One quality inspector suggested that as little as 150,000 tonnes could be shipped out this season.\nIvory Coast opened its 1996/97 coffee season late on November 14 amid plummeting prices, and forecast output at 230,000 tonnes against 180,000 last year.\nFarmgate prices were cut by 200 CFA to 500 CFA a kilo.\n"Farmers have been waiting for a price rise hoping it will be a sellers\' market," said one buyer. "Little care has been taken over sorting as farmers have less time, but exporters want better quality than last year."\nFarmers face a higher than normal January cocoa harvest as well.\n"This season will be twice a long as usual," said one buyer north of San Pedro, commenting on the slow start.\n"We should be busy into April," said a buyer around Soubre.\nBuyers expected to be at their busiest in February and March with port forwarders slating peak arrivals in April and May.\nLarge amounts of coffee could be seen along roadsides around buyers\' stores this week with stocks said to be rising.\nBuyers in most regions pointed to high percentages of black beans, fragments and bean husks.\n"Humidity is around 16 percent," said one buyer in San Pedro, against a 13 percent export standard. "Exporters are rejecting around 10 percent even after sorting," he added.\nOne buyer in Sassandra in the south said some farmers were delivering sacks with 50 percent of problem beans.\nQuality is widely seen as better in more productive northern areas around Man, where weather had been more favourable.\n"Farmers are only now getting the message about quality but we have been buying since November," said the manager of a new buying unit in Man opened by a processor.\nThe unit was advertising 30 CFA above guideline prices for top grades but paid 477 CFA for lower grades. Margins of up to two percent for quality variation applied within each grade.\nAbout one thousand tonnes had been bought by the end of January. Around 420 tonnes had left for Abidjan, with the rest, including 299 tonnes of low grade stocks, in Man warehouses.\nOther buyers in the Man area, which is expected to produce 30 percent (corrects from 80 percent) of Ivory Coast\'s coffee, said they could not match the prices paid by processors.\n"They can buy directly and save on transport and lower middleman charges," said one. Farmers had got into the habit of not sorting coffee in the past two years, he added.\nBanks have been reluctant to fund exporters\' buying operations out of concern that the Caistab would not pay up price support to its clients.\nBuyers said some large exporters had not bought any crop.\nA French coffee scientist based in Man said coffee bush flowering was good in many areas but dry Harmattan conditions could kill new fruits if rain did not fall.\n-- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90\n'

a(S'Port arrivals of 1996/97 Ivorian cocoa ranged between 745-755,000 tonnes by January 27 compared to 800,000 tonnes in 1995/96 as exporters cut up-country buying for lack of storage space, industry sources and exporters say.\n"There\'s cocoa all over the place," said one Abidjan exporter. "I have trucks waiting to unload but no space or pallets until I ship 5,000 tonnes next week," he added.\nCrop analysts returning from upcountry reported heavy pod loads in southwestern Ivorian hybrid plantations. Upcountry store managers told Reuters their stocks would rise into February.\nAll eyes are focused on weather data as favourable showers before April could swell mid crop cocoa volumes.\n"The trees need about 10 mm a week between now and then," said one plantation owner, giving a rough mid-crop forecast of 150,000-175,000 tonnes. "That of course depends on rain."\nOthers put the figure at over 100,000 tonnes, with one local crop forecaster more bullish at 200,000 tonnes. Ivory Coast notched up a record 1.2 million tonnes crop in 1995/96 after an unexpectedly strong 200,000 tonne mid-crop. The government has forecast 950,000 tonnes for 1996/97.\nThis season\'s arrivals were expected to be more strung out than last season\'s.\nOne crop analyst said,"When arrivals figures pick up again and reflect what is out there arrivals could be closer to a million before the mid crop starts."\nHis estimate was higher than most others.\nExporters in Ivory Coast\'s two main ports are battling to find warehouse space with many cutting purchasing until shipments leave.\nA late February surge is expected at San Pedro.\n"Everything will be off the trees by the end of February so a wave of cocoa will leave Ivory Coast against March contracts," said the Abidjan exporter. "San Pedro has been very busy."\nPort forwarders and inspectors reported improving bean quality with grain sizes below 100 beans per 100 grammes. Bean humidity levels had dropped to 6-8 percent from 8-10 percent in December and early January.\nExport standard is 105 beans and under per 100 grammes and eight percent and under for humidity.\nSan Pedro exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) has reported two drying plant fires.\nFull warehouses were surrounded by drying beans and lines of palleted cocoa fresh from trucks.\nA JAG cocoa and coffee plantation manager said a dryer might be sent down from his Gagnoa area site to speed up conditioning.\nSan Pedro processor SACO has full warehouses and more cocoa under awnings at the front of its plant.\n"January is definitely busier than last year but I don\'t have the figures immediately to hand," said one exporter. Warehouse space at San Pedro is set to rise from 1998 with forwarders SAGA building a 12,000 tonne capacity shed and an Ivorian maritime firm, SIVOM, planning another, smaller unit.\nBulk shipments loading improvements are also set to improve evacuation of cocoa from the port with forwarder SAGA planning to raise loading rates from 40 to 100 tonnes an hour.\nOne bulk ship, Pantelis K, left Ivory Coast last week with 7,000 tonnes.\nIndustry sources said upcountry buyers were transporting cocoa to port in 40 tonne loads on trucks designed for 23 tonnes.\nTilting and bent trailers, some being repaired along roadsides, were making their way to port through numerous police and army checkpoints.\n-- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90\n'

a(S'Ivory Coast opened three days of cocoa sector reform talks on Wednesday aimed at fine-tuning donor-sponsored liberalisation policies, with bean quality high on the agenda.\n"Liberalisation is about reducing the role of the state. We need less state but a better state," said Philippe Mian, president of Ivory Coast\'s Consultative Committee, which is hosting the talks which end on Friday.\nDutch Cocoa Association president Louis Bensdorp told Reuters two issues would dominate the talks.\n"The main issues are the quality of the cocoa and the assurance of contracts," he said before going into talks.\nIvory Coast\'s Consultative Committee, grouping Ivorian officials, loan donors and international cocoa industry bodies, was set up in October under the terms of a World Bank Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC).\nIvory Coast has liberalised internal and some external cocoa marketing functions since 1990 but there have been industry concerns over cocoa quality and the functioning of a new commodities auction system in place since May 1996.\nOther agenda items include an overall review of reforms, cocoa quality issues, local processing of cocoa and policy revision recommendations.\nIvory Coast\'s commodities minister, Guy-Alain Gauze, said reform revisions would help Ivory Coast\'s competitiveness.\n"A problem remains with importers about quality," Gauze told reporters before going into the private talks.\n"The proposals forming part of the sector reforms deal with quality and security of supplies for European and American importers," he added, referring to complaints by exporters that some firms were overbidding on the auction system to win contracts.\nRevisions to the auction system would be discussed but were not officially on the agenda, Mian told Reuters.\n"Nothing is perfect and the auction system could well have weak points which could be corrected and for which proposals could be made," he said during a midday break in talks.\nFurther cuts in the role of the Caistab marketing board would also be discussed, he added.\nDutch Cocoa Association president Bensdorp said industry would argue for changes to the auction system and seek better quality controls.\n"What we do not like is the 85 to 15 percent rule as there is too little chance for foreign companies to buy cocoa directly," he added.\nUnder auction rules 85 percent of Ivorian cocoa export rights are auctioned to local exporters, with the remaining 15 percent reserved by the Caistab for direct sale to traders abroad.\n"The problem is that, of the 15 percent, 10 percent is sold to Phibro so only five percent is available for the rest of international trade," he added.\nU.S.-based trader Phibro has a long-standing cocoa contract with the Caisab which is due to expire this year.\nBensdorp also referred to concerns over cocoa quality.\n"Usually we see a deterioration of quality after the main months, in fact about now. The main problem is a lack of proper quality checks," he said.\nWorld Bank, International Monetary Fund, European Union, International Cocoa Organization, France\'s development agency and Ivorian officials will issue their findings on Friday. -- Abidjan newsroom +225 21 90 90\n'

Ltd. said Tuesday that its Fox News division will file suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court here against Time Warner Inc., Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and its Chairman Ted Turner, alleging antitrust violations.\nNews Corp., which is led by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said the suit will allege that an antitrust conspiracy to block Fox News Channel in New York City has taken place prior to the still-to-be consummated merger.\n"The suit will allege that the conspiracy has taken place prior to the still-to-be-consummated merger," Arthur Siskind, News Corp. Group General Counsel, said in a brief statement. "The suit also charges Time Warner with breach of contract and fraud in reneging on its agreement to carry Fox News in New York City."\nLocked in a bitter campaign to win New York channel space for its Fox News service, News Corp. on Monday urged city officials to void cable-TV franchises with Time Warner Inc.\nNews Corp. executives told city officials at a hearing that the pending merger of Time Warner and Turner constituted a change of control of Time Warner\'s cable systems in New York City and allowed early rebidding for the valuable franchises.\nTime Warner holds city cable-television franchises serving 1.2 millions New Yorkers that are due to expire in 1998.\nTime Warner, which denies the merger constitutes a change in management control, has refused to carry the 24-hour Fox News service and instead carries two Cable News Network services owned by Turner, and MSNBC, a joint venture of General Electric Co.\'s NBC and Microsoft Corp.\nTurner and Time Warner are expected to merge on Thursday, creating the world\'s biggest media organisation. Turner Chairman Ted Turner will become vice chairman of the new company and will be the company\'s biggest shareholder.\nTime Warner is also opposing a proposal backed by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that Fox News be carried on a city-owned channel known as CrossWalks.\nGiulani has said that wide dissemination of Fox News throughout New York was important since it was the only all-news channel based within the city and was the source of hundreds of jobs.\nThe city\'s Franchise Concession and Review Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether or not the Turner-Time Warner deal should prompt a review of the Time Warner franchises.\nTime Warner executive Richard Aurelio said Monday that 90 percent of the regulators overseeing Time Warner\'s cable operations, the second largest in the United States, had passed without objection on the Turner-Time Warner merger.\n'

a(S'Riding rising U.S. cable TV fees, Time Warner Inc said its earnings before heavy debt payments shot up 32 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same three months last year.\nCovering the quarter before last Thursday\'s completion of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System, the entertainment group said three hit movies, strong magazine advertising sales helped by the Olympic Games, and good HBO results lifted cash flow to $964 million.\nRevenues for the three months ended Sept. 30 were $4.877 billion, up from $4.344 billion a year ago.\nLast year\'s third-quarter cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $729 million, the company said on Wednesday.\nTime Warner, many of whose cable TV and other businesses are co-owned with 25 percent partner U S West Inc. , reported a net loss of $167 million, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter.\nNet losses in last year\'s quarter were $160 million, or 41 cents a share, on 1.5 million more shares outstanding.\nNet interest costs were $276 million, up from $259 million in last year\'s third quarter. Preferred dividends rose to $76 million in the third quarter from $16 million.\nTime Warner\'s stock showed no gain after the results but rose smartly later in the day after top executives told institutional investors that debt reduction was centre stage at the company.\nThe executives said Time Warner is in active discussions aimed at restructuring its troubled cable-television partnership with U S West Media Group.\nOne Time Warner executive said the talks with regional phone group U S West, 25 percent owner of most of Time Warner\'s cable systems, studios and the HBO pay-TV service, are likely to quicken and could yield a deal within months.\n"We want to delever the company, lighten up on cable, and simplify the corporate capital structure," said the executive, speaking on a promise of anonymity.\nThe executives echoed Ted Turner, founder of Turner Broadcasting and now vice chairman of the combined company as well as its biggest individual shareholder. He has said he wants Time Warner\'s $17.5 billion debt halved.\nTime Warner now sees itself with the acquisition of Turner, producer of Cable News Network, The Cartoon Network and two studios, as primarily a programming group, the executives said.\nCapital-intensive cable operations are less important and ripe for partial divestment, the executives said. Investment capital can be better used outside cable, the executives said.\nEBITDA at Time Warner\'s cable operations, including those shared with with U S West, rose 14 percent to $512 million, the company said in its earnings report.\nBasic cable revenues rose sharply and advertising sales in cable also increased, the company said. With some 12.1 million customers, Time Warner is the nation\'s second-largest cable operator.\nTime Warner also had three summer movies grossing more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales -- "Twister," "Eraser" and "A Time To Kill".\nTime Warner shares rose $1.125 to $42 in New York Stock Exchange Trading.\n'

a(S'"Chainsaw Al" Albert Dunlap, the chief executive of Sunbeam Corp aiming to halve his workforce and add $1 billion in sales, ran into Wall Street skepticism.\nThe company\'s shares have been riding high, up more than 100 percent since Dunlap\'s appointment as Sunbeam CEO last summer, but dropped 1/2 to 25-1/4 on Tuesday after Dunlap said he would cut 6,000 jobs in restructuring the appliance group.\n"He\'s pulled off some amazing turnarounds," said Chapman Co analyst Daniel Noll. "But I\'m a little skeptical."  \n"I think the stock\'s a little ahead of itself," Noll said.\nDunlap, author of a current best-selling book, "Mean Business: How I Save Bad Companies And Make Good Companies Great", is credited with turning around Scott Paper Co and Lily-Tulip Co. He fiercely cuts staff and lifts stock values.\nIn addition to the "Chainsaw Al" moniker, the 59-year-old executive has also been dubbed "Darth Vader".\nOn Tuesday, Dunlap said he would halve to 6,000 the worldwide staff of Sunbeam, eliminate dozens of factories, regional adminstrative offices and warehouses, and stop making more than 85 percent of Sunbeam\'s 11,500 products.  \nHe also promised to sell Sunbeam\'s furniture business, open fresh sales avenues such as outlet stores, strike overseas marketing alliances, and eliminate all debt by next year. The company might launch share buybacks or make acquisitions once debt is paid off, he said.\nSales will double by 1999 to $2 billion, he said.\n"It will be vintage Dunlap," Dunlap said in a conference call with institutional investors and analysts.\nAnalysts pressed Dunlap on specifics for doubling sales and when and with whom Sunbeam would align itself.  \nDunlap declined to identify potential deal partners but said new products, including many designed for non-U.S. markets, would along with other steps yield 20 percent or better year-over-year revenue growth.\n"It takes some length of faith from us," analyst Scott Grant of Oppenheimer said during the conference call.\nOther analysts questioned whether Dunlap\'s reliance on outsourcing -- hiring other manufacturers to make Sunbeam and Oster products -- was feasible as the company will have only eight factories to make its 1,500 remaining products.\nThe restructuring was very ambitious, involving deeper staff cuts, consolidation and tougher goals than had been expected since Dunlap began firing Sunbeam executives last July, analysts said.\n"\'Chainsaw Al\' is a pussycat name for you," analyst Andrew Shore of Paine Webber told Dunlap. "If you pull this off, you should be called \'Nuclear Al\'."\n-- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1713\n'

a(S"Born as the world's first airborne crop-dusting service, Delta Air Lines Inc. may be on the verge of an alliance that would make it the industry's top gun.\nThe New York Times and Wall Street Journal, both quoting sources familiar with the discussions, reported that Delta and Continental Airlines have been talking about a merger for several months. The Times said a deal was not imminent.\nShould Atlanta-based Delta merge with Continental, the new company would be the world's largest carrier.\nThe newspaper reports contained few financial details, but Standard and Poor's Corp. said it may change its ratings on Continental and Delta debt based on the reports of the talks.\nA merger would fill gaps in each carrier's routes and create a powerhouse that would be certain to draw attention of regulators in Washington.\nBoth companies declined to comment on the reported talks.\nDelta, the nation's No. 3 carrier, had a historic summer. Atlanta, where Delta has a major hub, hosted the Summer Olympics attended by tens of thousands who flew on the airline, which posted its best earnings for a quarter, $238 million, on revenues of $3.43 billion.\nBut Delta, which moved to Atlanta in 1941 and helped transform the sleepy Southern city into a business center after World War II, still faces stiff competition.\nIn addition to its traditional rivals such as United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, and No. 2 American Airlines, it also faces newer, low-cost rivals such as ValuJet Inc..\nIn the talks with Houston-based Continental, Delta may be trying to get a headstart on another possible round of mergers in the industry. Carriers flush with cash from two years of solid earnings could seek mergers in a slow-growth business.\nDelta itself has long been a buyer of rivals.\nStarted 72 years ago as Huff-Daland Dusters to combat the boll weevil, the company bought Chicago and Southern Airlines in 1952 and spread its routes into the South, Midwest, Texas and the Caribbean.\nNearly two decades later, in 1961, Delta moved into New England and Canada by acquiring Northeast Airlines. Its first trans-Atlantic flights, to London, began in 1978. It bought Western Air Lines in 1986.\nBy the late 1980s, international routes accounted for more than 10 percent of Delta's revenues and the company formed alliances with Swissair and Singapore Airlines.\nIn 1990, it launched a computer-reservation service, Worldspan, in a venture with Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, to compete with Sabre, the dominant reservations system 84-percent owned by American Airlines parent AMR Corp. .\nThe following year Delta cherry-picked planes, airport gates, routes and other properties from troubled Eastern Airlines and Pan American World Airways as the economy weakened, concluding a troubled $1.2 billion purchase of Pan Am in 1991.\nLike most of the industry, Delta posted losses in the four years through 1994.\n"

a(S'VTR Galaxy Chile SA won government permission to offer direct-to-home (DTH) television and will start selling the DIRECTV service in Chile by March 31, the head of DIRECTV\'s Latin American operations said on Wednesday.\nThe approval by the Transportation and Telecommunications Ministry gives DIRECTV, a consortium of a Hughes Electronics unit and three Latin American companies, a lead over rival DTH services in Chile, Galaxy Latin America chief executive Jose Antonio Rios said.  \n"We will begin with advertising about the middle of December, telling people about the number of channels. From then we won\'t let up," Rios said.\nBillboards, newspaper advertising and television will all be used to promote the multi-channel TV service. In addition, the campaign will rely heavily on in-store demonstrations, Rios said.\nVTR, a partnership of Luksic and Southwestern Bell Corp and DIRECTV will spend the next months training retail clerks in presenting the receivers, he said. Full availability in Chile will come by March 31, he said.  \nDIRECTV is sold in Latin America and the Caribbean by Galaxy Latin America, a venture of Hughes, The Cisneros Group of Venezuela, Televisao Abril of Brazil and MVS Multivision of Mexico. It offers subscribers who buy a receiver about 100 channels of video, music and extra-fee film channels. Several companies, including the Sky venture involving News Corp, are offering satellite television in Latin America, a fast-growing region lightly penetrated by cable television.  \nDIRECTV has been a huge hit in the United States, hailed as the fastest selling consumer electronics item ever since its 1994 launch and credited by some industry analysts with eating into the dominant cable industry\'s audiences.\nRios said DIRECTV has some 16,000 vendors throughout the region selling its receivers and expects that number to nearly double to 30,000 by the end  of 1997.\nThe company expects soon to launch in Trinidad and Barbados and in Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rico, Panama and Argentina by June 30.\nRios said DIRECTV would be available in 23 nations in Latin America and the Caribbean by the end of 1997.\nThe service is now available in Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela.\n-- Miami newsroom, 305-374-5013\n'

a(S'A Florida judge said Friday that he was inclined to let stand civil claims filed under state anti-racketeering laws against the tobacco industry.\nSpeaking from the bench at the start of a preliminary hearing, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen said he was inclined to let stand claims filed by the state using Florida\'s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupts Organisations Act, which could mean more losses for cigarette makers.\n"It would seem that the state can maintain the RICO actions," Cohen said.\nThe claims under state RICO laws were added last month to the state\'s existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion compensation for treating smokers\' illnesses.\nThe judge said he would not make up his mind until the end of oral arguments on Friday.\nHe gave no timetable for making public his decision on a request by Philip Morris Cos. and other cigarette makers that the claims made by the state under RICO laws be thrown out.\nFlorida State Attorney General Bob Butterworth said before the hearing that a victory against tobacco companies using the RICO law would allow the court to triple the more than $1 billion dollars in damages claimed by the state.\nHe also said a victory in Florida using its RICO law would widen the war against the tobbaco industry by possibly allowing other states to sue under their own RICO laws.\nLawyer Irving Nathan, representing the tobacco industry, said that lawsuits brought by state governments under anti-racketeering laws were meant to demonise cigarette manufacturers and turn Americans against a legitimate industry.\nNathan argued that the RICO laws did not apply to the tobacco companies that are also being sued in Florida.\nThe state of Florida in 1995 filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, seeking $1 billion or more for health care costs paid for poor people afflicted with smoking-related ailments.\nLast month the state amended the suit using the RICO law and claiming that the tobacco companies had conspired with one another to confuse Americans about the dangers of smoking.\nCohen is not expected to rule for weeks on the tobacco defendents\' request that the RICO claims be dismissed but he said in opening remarks that he was inclined to allow the Florida state lawyers to go ahead with the RICO-based claims.\nA jury trial of the suit is tentatively scheduled for August 1997, the judge said.\nMississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who accompanied Butterworth to the hearing along with Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, said the lawsuits filed by 19 states and several cities were about much more than mere money. The lawsuits were needed to alert people to the dangers of smoking and help curb smoking among teenagers.\n"That helps me sell the litigation more than the money," Moore said.\n'

a(S'Cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, Friday dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the state of Florida in a multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit.\nFlorida is seeking $1 billion or more from U.S. cigarette makers for actual costs incurred in its Medicaid healthcare programme for treating people afflicted with smoking-related ailments. Punitive damages, assuming a victory for the state, raise the potential losses to the industry substantially.\nThe state last month won the right to claim even further damages under Florida\'s anti-racketeering laws, a legal precedent in the spreading courtroom battle against tobacco companies. State lawyers have said the racketeering claims could cost cigarette makers tens of billions of dollars.\nA lawyer for Philip Morris Cos Inc., one of the defending tobacco companies, said in a news release that ending pre-trial opposition had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.\nFlorida Attorney General Bob Butterworth hailed the action as victory and said the industry had made a major legal concession to delay harsh disclosures during a scheduled Jan. 24 hearing about industry marketing and medical research practices.\n"I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty," Butterworth said in an interview. "They want to delay. It\'s their best short-term ploy."\nButterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in 27,000 pages of documents to have been presented on Jan. 24 but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in anti-tobacco lawsuits filed by 18 states.\n"It\'s nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science ... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity," Butterworth said.\nPhilip Morris lawyer Gregory Little said a key reason for the industry\'s decision was a worry that the state lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during the hearing open to journalists. Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.\n"... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs lawyers to once again trumpet their case ...," Little said.\nHe accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters and polluting the pool of unbiased potential jurors needed for a fair trial.\nThe judge in the Florida trial, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida, last fall threw out 15 of the state government\'s original 18 claims.\nDefendants in the case, one of several such lawsuits brought by state governments scheduled to go to trial this year, include RJR Nabisco Holdings and the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain.\nThe industry may receive another legal blow if a reported campaign by Brooke Group, parent of cigarette maker Ligget Group Inc., to settle Medicaid claims in a deal that could involve the exchange of confidential documents.\nLiggett was last year the first tobacco company to ever settle cigarette lawsuits in an accord with five states which had sued the industry to recoup health-care costs of smokers.\n'

a(S'Florida Panthers Holdings Inc\'s cash flow losses are narrowing because of strong professional hockey revenues and a lift from newly acquired leisure properties, President Richard Evans said Tuesday .\n"The games are sold out, and advertising and sponsorship revenue is better than expected," Evans told Reuters after a presentation to investors at a conference sponsored by Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc. "We also are benefitting for part of the year from the hotel and Incredible Ice properties."  \nHe predicted the company would have a cash flow loss, defined as earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), of about $3.1 million for the 12 months ending June 30.\nThe Fort Lauderdale-based company forecast last November, when it made a 7.0 million share initial offering, that EBIDTA losses would total about $15 million in the fiscal year through June.\nEvans said EBITDA should turn positive and total $3.1 million or more in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998.  \nEBITDA should total $22.5 million in the following fiscal year, when the Panthers hockey team will have 12 months\' occupancy of a new, $185-million arena being built in Broward County north of Miami.\nThe arena will seat 19,000 during hockey games, stimulate ticket, souvenir and food revenues, and draw from three South Florida counties with four million residents, Evans said.\nThe Panthers, which now play in the Miami Arena, will also get a bigger share of concession profits than under the current deal, he said.  \nHe declined to predict when Panthers Holdings would turn profitable.\nEvans said he spent two-thirds of his time working on possible acquisitions, under the direction of majority shareholder and Chairman Wayne Huizenga, and that deals were likely this year. He said leisure properties, particularly involving golf, were of keen interest to Panther Holdings.\nSince November, Panthers Holdings has bought two marina hotels in Fort Lauderdale, in stock deals, and paid $15.5 million for Incredible Ice, an ice rink offering a spectrum of entertainments. Evans said Incredible Ice sites were likely to be opened elsewhere in the United States.\n"The market has given us an incredible currency, and we intend to use it," he said.\nPanthers Holdings shares have nearly tripled from their $10 offering price in November.\nEvans said all acquisitions would be accretive to cash flow and were very likely to be stock transactions\nHuizenga said in a speech at the Raymond James conference Monday night that deals for the Panthers were likely.\n((--Miami Newsroom 305-374-5013))\n'

a(S'China on Sunday used a Long March 2D rocket to fire a scientific research satellite into orbit from a base in the remote northwestern province of Gansu, the Xinhua news agency said.\nThe successful launch of the remote-sensing satellite followed a string of setbacks for the Chinese space industry that have sent insurance premiums for commercial launches soaring.\n"The satellite went smoothly into orbit and all instruments aboard are operating well," Xinhua said.\nThe launch of the satellite, which is designed to spend 15 days in orbit before returning to earth for retrieval, was the third successfully completed by the two-stage, liquid-fuelled Long March 2D rocket, the official agency said.\nChina\'s space industry, once much admired for its bargain prices and its strong track record of launch successes, has been plagued by problems in recent years.\nIn August, a domestic communications satellite launched aboard a Long March 3 rocket from Xichang in the southwestern province of Sichuan failed to reach its proper orbit.\nIn February, a Long March 3B carrying an Intelsat satellite veered wildly seconds after lift-off before exploding in mid-air near the Xichang space centre.\nChina said six people were killed, 57 injured and 80 homes destroyed in the incident. Video footage smuggled out of China by an Israeli scientist showed dozens of levelled buildings and suggested the casualties were higher.\nChinese officials said the loss of the rocket and its payload was caused by a failure of the "inertia platform" that operates the rocket\'s directional controls.\nIn January 1995, a Long March 2E rocket blew up, killing a family of six in a rain of debris and destroying the Hughes-built Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.\nThe failures, although hardly exceptional in the high-risk satellite business, have sent insurance premiums for Chinese launches soaring, eroding China\'s price advantage over Western and Japanese competitors.\nSeveral launch contracts with foreign companies were cancelled following the setbacks, partly because of concerns over delays due to China\'s launch backlog.\nChina says it still has a high success rate, with only a handful of the 43 launches carried out by its Long March rocket series going wrong, and officials said this month they had tightened safety measures to prevent further disasters.\nLaunch vehicles would now self-destruct in the case of failure and officials would ensure people living nearby are evacuated before each launch.\nIn July, China took a step towards restoration its reputation for reliability when it successfully launched the Apstar 1A satellite.\n'

a(S'The family of jailed Chinese dissident Wang Dan on Friday received official confirmation of his 11-year prison sentence, suggesting the way was now clear for the former student leader to appeal his conviction.\nA Beijing court on Wednesday took less than four hours to condemn Wang for plotting against the government after a trial that sparked expressions of concern from around the world.\nWang\'s family received official notification of the verdict on Friday afternoon, implying the 27-year-old activist was now free to appeal within 10 days, said his mother Wang Lingyun.\n"The verdict should be first given to him, with another (copy) given to the family," she said in a telephone interview.\n"This is an issue for Wang Dan, he has to write an appeal document...for the higher court," she said. "After the court has received it they may inform us."\nWang, a dissident known for his role as a leader of the ill-fated 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square, had pleaded not guilty to subversion charges carrying a maximum death sentence and a minimum 10 years\' imprisonment.\nDuring a brief meeting with his family after the trial he vowed to appeal, a decision widely considered to be a symbolic gesture as verdicts imposed on Chinese dissidents in past political trials have almost never been overturned.\nThe 11-year sentence imposed on Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows on China\'s embattled band of dissidents, most of whom were already in exile or serving long terms in adminstrative detention or jail.\nIt drew immediate fire from international human rights activists, who condemned the trial as a parody of justice masking a pre-arranged result.\nChinese state media called the trial a model of fairness. Officials said it was an ordinary legal matter and an internal affair.\nThe United States and some European and Asian nations expressed their concern, while Czech President Vaclav Havel -- himself a former dissident against a communist government -- said the verdict was unacceptable and deeply disturbing.\nWang, who once promoted free debate on the campus of Beijing University, had already served four years in prison after the 1989 protests were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.\nThe former history student returned to activism after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to Beijing\'s communist leadership for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 demonstrations.\nHe was detained once more in May 1995 and disappeared into legal limbo for almost a year and a half until being formally arrested.\nWang Lingyun, a 61-year old museum researcher who attended the trial as one of Wang\'s two defence lawyers, said it was unclear when she would be able to meet her son again.\n"If he continues to ask me to be his defence lawyer, it\'s possible we will be able to have a lawyer\'s meeting, like last time," she said. "It\'s his decision."\nThe family had had little time to discuss the details of Wang\'s appeal during their 30-minute meeting at a Beijing detention centre on Wednesday, she said.\n"Last time we didn\'t speak much, because the time was so short," she said. "We hadn\'t seen each other for such a long time, we just talked about family things."\n'

a(S'Beijing accused the United States on Tuesday of pursuing hostile policies towards China and defended a campaign to boost patriotism as a shield against aggressive foreign forces.\n"In the last few years the United States has pursued antagonistic policies toward China," said the official People\'s Daily, mouthpiece of China\'s ruling Communist Party.\n"U.S. media circles have spared no effort to attack and sully China," it said as disarmament talks between Chinese and U.S. officials entered a second day in Beijing.\nU.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis began talks on arms proliferation in the Chinese capital on Monday, part of a visit seen as a vital step towards rebuilding ties long strained by disputes over trade, human rights, copyright piracy and Taiwan.\nBoth sides, however, say relations have warmed in recent months after a string of high-level meetings. But the Chinese state press has continued to issue harshly worded condemnations of U.S. policies and individuals seen as hostile to Beijing.\nIn an angry reaction to an article in the New York Times on October 24 by former U.S. ambassador to China James Lilley, People\'s Daily slammed the U.S. media for unfriendly reporting that was harming vital cross-Pacific ties.\nIn his signed opinion piece, Lilley wrote that the loss of communism\'s appeal in China had left a vacuum that was being filled by nationalist xenophobia, but warned that nationalism was a dangerous road to take.\nPeople\'s Daily said no such warning was required.\n"(Some Westerners) see Chinese people\'s patriotism as being narrow-minded nationalism that will be catastrophic for the West and must quickly be discarded," it said.\nOver 100 years of abuse at the hands of imperial powers had taught Chinese how to be patriotic without straying into blind xenophobia, it said.\nWashington\'s anti-Chinese actions did not stop at thwarting Beijing\'s bid to hold the 2000 Olympics or at U.S. threats over human rights, trade or nuclear proliferation, it said.\nChinese feelings had been badly hurt by outrages such as Washington\'s dispatch of two aircraft carriers to the seas near Taiwan in March, it added.\nWashington sent the aircraft carrier battlegroups to monitor intimidatory war games and missile tests carried out by China near Taiwan in the run-up to the island\'s first direct presidential elections, a decision that infuriated Beijing.\n"It is this kind of pressure from the United States and other Western countries that has inspired the enthusiasm of the Chinese people\'s patriotism," People\'s Daily said.\n"This kind of intense spontaneous reaction to interference by foreign forces is an ordinary manifestation of the Chinese people\'s patriotism," it said.\n"Only when the motherland is strong and prosperous can the interference and aggression of outside forces be fundamentally resisted and forestalled," it said.\nAnalysts say Beijing is keen to boost nationalist sentiment in China to fill an ideological vacuum caused by the rush from strict communist values to a market-style economy.\nRepeated calls for more patriotism have been accompanied by repeated state media diatribes against the United States and by a mass campaign for a return to orthodox socialist values.\n'

a(S'China congratulated U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday for his election triumph, saying the victory presented a good opportunity to improve ties between Washington and Beijing.\nClinton\'s sweeping win over Republican rival Bob Dole is good news for a Beijing leadership which prefers to deal with familiar statesmen, Chinese academics and officials said.\n"We wish to congratulate President Clinton on his re-election," Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said.\n"Now, a good opportunity has presented itself for improving and expanding Sino-U.S. relations," Cui told reporters. "Some positive progress has been made in bilateral relations, with a somewhat improved atmosphere."\nChina was ready to work with Washington for further progress on the basis of past Sino-U.S. joint agreements, he said.\nWhile Clinton had presided over four years of Sino-U.S. ties often strained by disputes over trade, human rights, arms proliferation and Taiwan, his re-election could help stabilise relations, Chinese academics said.\n"The result should be a good thing for Sino-U.S. ties. After four years Clinton now understands China to a certain extent and there is some stability in his China policy," said one academic at a U.S.-funded election party in Beijing.\n"Another four years should allow some improvement in relations," said the specialist in international strategic studies, who declined to be identified.\n"Clinton is an opponent we know well," said a government official at the reception, where invited U.S. and Chinese guests watched electoral results emerge over satellite television and real time Internet links.\n"It\'s like basketball: if the Chicago Bulls come to play the Beijing team and the two sides have never met before, it won\'t be a good game," said the official who declined to be named.\n"Neither side knows what the other can do," he said.\nWashington and Beijing both say ties have thawed since the two sides narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Taiwan earlier this year.\nCautious optimism was the tone taken by many of the Chinese specialists and officials at the reception in a Beijing hotel, where cola, hamburgers and live election coverage were served up by U.S. businesses keen to boost cross-Pacific understanding.\n"The Chinese leaders... like to deal with U.S. presidents whom they know personally," said Professor Xu Cunyao of the Ministry of Culture\'s Institute for Administrators\' Education.\n"I think the Chinese leaders will be very happy with this result," he said.\nDespite the diplomatic spats of recent years, Sino-U.S. economic and trade ties had grown relatively fast during Clinton\'s tenure, Gu Yuanyang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said in a telephone interview.\n"We are all satisfied with this result because it will have a certain positive effect on the recovery and development of Sino-Chinese relations," said Gu, director of the academy\'s Institute of World Economics and Politics.\nRelations would not improve automatically, he said, adding Clinton should push for high-level contacts, ensure China\'s trade status, smooth Beijing\'s entry to the World Trade Organisation and refrain from creating difficulties on Taiwan.\n'

a(S'Sprint Corp said on Tuesday  it put its local telephone ventures with cable television companies on a back burner because there are more immediate opportunities in reselling existing local telephone service.\n"For a lot of reasons the wireline ventures with the cable TV companies moved ... to a back burner," Arthur Krause, Sprint chief financial officer told Reuters.\nSprint\'s cable partners are Tele-Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and Cox Communications Inc, which together reach 30 million households.  \nThey had planned to be an early part of Sprint\'s plan to offer bundled local, long distance and wireless telephone with cable TV on a single bill across the United States.\nKrause said faster-than-expected legislative action from the Federal Communications Commission had opened up chances of earlier interconnection deals with incumbent local telephone companies than had been expected two years or so ago.\nSome analysts believe there are technical and strategic difficulties too, which have already led to local services being arranged as several separate ventures rather than one common branded service as originally planned.  \nKrause predicted Sprint\'s first such resale deal would precede any offerings of local service in partnership with the cable TV companies, but gave no exact timings.\nHe noted that resale was always a major part of the plan, because Sprint can only reach 11 million of the 100 million U.S. homes through its own local telephone service unit, and its cable partners reach only another 30 million.\nEventually local service would be provided broadly on Sprint-owned facilities, he said.  \nSprint reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday and pleased analysts with its operating performance, but the stock remains weighed by worries over its ambitious plans, like Sprint PCS, a multi-billion dollar wireless venture.\nKrause said the market should see Sprint as two companies.\n"We have been encouraging people to look separately at the core operation and at the ventures," he said.\nSprint\'s core telephone operations should be analyzed based on their earnings, while the new cash-hungry ventures  should be approached on a discounted cash flow basis, he said.  \n"(Otherwise)...the value of the new ventures ends up as less than zero," he said.\nKrause declined comment on estimates of dilution caused by Sprint PCS ahead of the finalization of the venture\'s 1997 business plan, which he expected within 30 days.  Analysts expect dilution of $450 miilion to $650 million in 1997.\nKrause said he was encouraged that churn, or customer turnover, was declining in its long distance operations, particularly when others were being hit hard.\n"(Nevertheless) churn rates still exceed what anyone would hope they would be," he said.\nAT&amp;T Corp said in September that high churn in this competitive marketplace was one of the reasons that it predicted an earnings shortfall for the third quarter.\nKrause said Sprint\'s marketing encouraged customers to remain with the company.\n"Sprint Sense has a cashback plan that basically rewards people who stay a year or longer," he said, of a consumer market plan.  For small business customers he said that the "Fridays Free" campaign had been equally successful. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712\n'

a(S'GTE Corp. Wednesday said earnings rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosted by strong demand for new phone lines from people setting up businesses or hooking up computers at home.\nThe results were in line with expectations, but GTE\'s stock jumped as investors cheered the report from the nation\'s largest local telephone company, as well a court ruling late on Tuesday that suspended key parts of federal rules designed to foster competition in local phone markets.\nOther local phone company stocks also rose after the ruling by a three-judge appeals court panel in St. Louis. The judges said they had "serious doubts" about the Federal Communication Commission\'s authority to impose its pricing policies.\nThe FCC rules, among other things, would require the Baby Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.\nAnalysts said state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts. The appellate panel put the new rules on hold while it considers a court challenge to the FCC\'s plan.\nThe challenge to the FCC rules had been spearheaded by GTE, which was joined by some of the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.\n"(The legal challenge) improves the probability for getting higher prices to resell local networks than under the FCC guidance," said Bette Massick at brokers Bear Stearns.\nGTE jumped $3.625 to $42.25 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nOther Bell stocks that rose included BellSouth, up $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic, ahead $2.125 to $60.875, Nynex, which gained $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech, up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis, which added $1.375 to $34.625, all on the NYSE.\nIn its report, Stamford, Conn.-based GTE said net income rose to $756 million, or 78 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $695 million, or 72 cents a share, in the 1995 period.\nThe results matched analysts\' forecasts of 78 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. The 1995 figures included a gain of $11 million, or 1 cent a share, from the sale of secondary telephone properties.\nSales grew 7 percent to $5.34 billion from $5.0 billion.\nIn addition to strong line demand, GTE cited growth in its cellular and long-distance services.\n"The continued pace of our revenue growth, driven by record line growth as well as strong demand for new and enhanced services, is particularly encouraging," Chairman Charles Lee said in a statement.\nThe number of domestic access lines grew 7 percent in the quarter, with more than half the growth in the residential side of the business from additional lines to the home, GTE said.\nGTE said its number of cellular customers grew almost 5 percent in the quarter, while cellular revenue surged 15 percent.\nIt also said it doubled its number of long-distance customers to more than 500,000 from the end of the second quarter.\n'

a(S'AT&amp;T Corp., ending weeks of speculation, said Wednesday that its board elected John Walter, chairman of printing company R.R. Donnelley and Sons, as its new president, chief operating officer and heir apparent to Chairman Robert Allen.\nThe giant communications company said that Walter, 49, was unanimously elected Tuesday night to the two management posts and as a member of the board, effective Nov. 1.\n"I\'m confident John Walter brings leadership qualities that will make the new AT&amp;T successful, not only in the hotly contested long-distance market, but across the whole range of rapidly growing communications services," Allen, 61, said in a statement.\nIndustry analysts, however, were stunned that AT&amp;T had not chosen a better-known executive. They were also concerned that an 18-month handover would not lead to a quick enough change in strategy.\nAT&amp;T stock fell $2 to $37.75 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most active issues in afternoon trading. Adjusted for the split off of Lucent Technologies Inc., AT&amp;T shares have fallen 16 percent this year -- about the same as the broad market has risen.\n"This (Walter) is not a candidate to lead the rally," said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg.\n"I was expecting 12 months (handover) at most," said Chris Landis, an analyst at consultancy Telechoice Inc., and a former AT&amp;T executive. "I think most insiders were, too."\nThe president and COO posts were left vacant after Alex Mandl resigned suddenly in August to head a small, new wireless company, Associated Communications.\nAT&amp;T said its board considered a number of candidates but quickly focused on Walter because his track record at Chicago-based Donnelley, the world\'s largest commercial printer, fit well with the challenges at AT&amp;T.\n"He\'s transformed a large, old-line company challenged by new technologies and changing markets into a tough global competitor. Meeting those challenges is what leading the new AT&amp;T is all about," Allen said.\nAllen said that starting in January 1998 he and Walter would split the duties of chairman and chief executive, with Walter becoming chairman later that year.\n"The board and I have every expectation that John will become chairman and CEO of AT&amp;T," Allen said.\nWalter, who joined R.R. Donnelley in 1969 as a trainee, held numerous positions in the publishing and information company, becoming chairman in 1989.\n"During the 10 years of his operational leadership, Donnelley steadily increased revenue, earnings and cash flow in an industry experiencing little growth," AT&amp;T said in its announcement. "It also transformed itself."\nToday Donnelley is a global leader in managing and distributing information -- from magazines to software disks and online services.\nExpectations of an early end to Allen\'s career were heightened when the company warned in September that its earnings would be weaker than expected.\nAT&amp;T\'s operating profits of $1.36 billion, or 84 cents a share, for the third quarter were off about 11 percent from $1.53 billion, or 96 cents a share, a year ago. The drop in operating profits came as increased competition and higher marketing expenses hit the cmopany\'s core long-distance phone business, while financial services sank into losses.\nIndustry analysts had speculated that Allen would surrender the role of chief executive, rather than chairman, to the new candidate and retain his chairmanship until nearer his retirement.\nAnalyst say top candidates, like George Fisher of Eastman Kodak, may have been put off by the lengthy transition time to the top job while Allen remains in charge.\n"I heard the reason Fisher taker didn\'t take the job was the 18-month delay before taking the reins," said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.\nHowever, a source close to AT&amp;T, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no tentative or firm offers were made to any candidates who subsequently withdrew. AT&amp;T declined to comment.\n'

a(S'MCI Communications Corp., the nation\'s second-largest long distance provider, said Friday it was in talks with British Telecommunications Plc on a possible merger of the two companies.\nBritish Telecom already holds a 20 percent stake in MCI.\nAn MCI spokesman told Reuters the company expected the talks to be concluded this weekend, although he noted that there were no guarantees an agreement would be reached.\n"We have entered into negotations with BT on a possible business combination," the spokesman said, reading from a prepared statement.\nIndustry analysts applauded the talks, saying a combination of the two companies would be a good fit in the super-competitive U.S. long distance phone industry, where MCI and No. 3 Sprint have been battling an ailing AT&amp;T Corp.\n"This is an extremely competitive business, and horizontal mergers like this make sense," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors. "The economies of scale in this case could be considerable, and the leverage in terms of potential profits is high ... It would be good purchase."\nMCI\'s stock was halted for trading at $27.25, up $1.875 on Nasdaq, although it jumped as much as $5 to $30.625 after CNBC television reported that the companies were talking. The exchange said it would investigate those trades.\n"It would be a good fit for British Telecom and provide a major foothold in this country," said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.\n"It wouldn\'t take away from the long-distance battle. Before that\'s over, there will be losers and winners," he added.\nCNBC said Lazard Freres, MCI\'s investment bankers, and Morgan Stanley were working on the deal, which it said could be worth upward of $22 billion.\n"It makes sense," said Kevin Haggerty, senior vice president and manager of equity trading at Fidelity Investments. "I think BT is a great company.  The synergy is there. BT made a great initial investment."\n'

a(S'Hordes of aggressive telephone resellers banging at the gates of AT&amp;T Corp, Sprint Corp and MCI Communications Corp have already grabbed $12 billion of the $80 billion long distance market.\nBut Monday\'s merger between MFS Communications Co Inc and WorldCom Inc allows tiny resellers to swarm into a rich citadel industry giants see as their own.\n"Its international services, data, Internet and intranet as well as local service resale," said analyst Daryl Edmonds of brokers Bear Stearns.  \nMFS is a provider of local calling networks to businesses, while WorldCom is a long distance and international carrier.\nMFS WorldCom will be a ferocious competitor itself, able to offer end-to-end business services, but as a carrier\'s carrier it will allow in many resellers to new markets, by offering "own brand" telecommunication services off the shelf.\nFast growing resellers like Excel Communications Inc, one of over 400 such firms in the industry, have helped to eat away at the long distance telephone market and set the standard for cheap service, analysts say.  \nFor long distance companies, and regional Bells trying to defend their home turf, it will mean more competition, more pressure on margins and harder work to keep customers.\nProfit margins and growth rates in high speed data, dedicated access Internet, international calling and broadband applications like videoconferencing are way beyond that seen in long distance, which is becoming a commodity market.\nResellers would threaten future sources of growth for the biggest firms in the industry.  \n"You now have one company, MFS WorldCom, which crystallizes the brave new world (of competition)," said Simon Flannery of brokers J. P. Morgan.\nHe said resellers could always have pieced together such services, but this merger will make it easier.\nResellers focused on consumer services will not even be competing with MFS WorldCom\'s own branded product, which is pitched at small businesses.\nUUNET, which MFS bought for $2 billion earlier this month, will be particularly empowered as a carrier of the internet services of others.  \nAs part of MFS WorldCom it will be able to call on 2,900 sales people across the country instead of 63.\n"We think it is a very positive move for the reseller market place," MFS WorldCom chief executive designate Bernard Ebbers said during Monday\'s merger news conference, mentioning Excel and GTE Corp as possible buyers of services.\nGTE and some regional Bells are already buying long distance services from WorldCom for their entry into that market. Using MFS\'s networks, they could now extend local services into cities in other parts of the country.  \nThis new competition is one of the aims of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, but the irony is this merger -- of an outsider in long distance and an outsider in local telephone -- could have happened even without deregulation.\n"Both companies were unencumbered by national regulation," said Edmonds though he noted that to reach the greatest market opportunity they still need access to some elements of the Bell\'s local networks, a process eased by the telecom act.\n"MCI or Sprint will say \'we can do this too\'," said Flannery.\nHowever, they are some way behind in their reach.\nMCI this morning detailed its local phone service plans, but its MCI Metro network will only reach 25 cities by March 1997, while MFS already has 45 cities up and running.\nHowever, analysts reckon it will be some time before MFS WorldCom can become a threat in the really high margin areas of dealing with the national or global communication accounts of large companies.\n-- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712\n'

a(S'Worries about regulatory hurdles and a lengthy 12 months to completion took the edge off market euphoria over MCI Communications Corp\'s merger with British Telecommunications Corp, analysts said on Monday.\nMCI shares were trading on Monday morning just 1/4 firmer at 30-1/2, well adrift of a theoretical value that oscillated around $39 per share, based on the price of BT American depositary shares.  \n"The arbs are probably demanding between 15 and 20 percent on this deal because of the lengthy time to closing and the uncertainties of U.S. regulatory approval," said analyst Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.\nThe deal is an offer of 0.54 new American depositary shares in the new combined group, named Concert, for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one BT American depositary share and $6 cash.  \nAnalysts noted a yawning gap between the value of the deal taken by using BT shares in London and the ADS shares, and a fuzzy debate about how much of the $5.60 BT special dividend should be deducted from the ADS price.\n"It depends on what you use as the implied exchange rate," said analyst Julie Kennedy of Goldman Sachs. At Monday\'s one pound equals $1.64, the ADS shares look to be too far ahead.\nIn any case the final calculations will seesaw with changes in both BT\'s stock price and the exchange rate.  \nGiven the broader uncertainties, arbitragers didn\'t expect to push up the shares to the point where they would have to go over the details looking for the last few cents.\n"MCI is trading where is should, in line with BT based on a nine to 12 month transaction, and figuring MCI holders not getting the special (BT) dividends," one arbitrager said.\nAnalysts say the market is not expecting much of the possible buyback of up to 10 percent of Concert shares, which could take place after the deal closes.\nKlugman said that though a buyback spreads a given level of earnings over fewer shares, the cost of purchase show up in operating earnings as higher interest charges.\nBy how much earnings per share improves hinges on how much cheaper debt is than equity, analysts say.  -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610\n'

a(S'British Telecom and MCI Communications on Sunday announced a $20 billion merger, using the largest cross-border takeover deal in history to spawn a global telecommunications powerhouse.\nThe merged company, to be called Concert Plc, creates the world\'s second-largest telecommunications group, based on market capitalization, behind Japan\'s NTT Corp.\nValued at $54 billion based on Friday\'s closing stock prices, Concert is neck-and-neck with U.S. long-distance leader AT&amp;T Corp., which is MCI\'s arch-rival in the super-competitive U.S. market.\nFor customers, the deal promises better service and lower international calling charges, while for businesses it means a company that can support them wherever they are. For for shareholders, it means faster earnings growth, analysts said.\n"This is not a pebble we\'re throwing onto a quiet pool. It is a big rock, and it\'s going to make a big splash," Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications Plc, told a news conference in New York.\nThe deal values all of Washington,D.C.-based MCI at a total $25.2 billion. But as British Telecom already owns 20 percent, it will issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion for the 80 percent it does not own. Holders of this MCI stake will thus control 33 percent of the stock in the combined company.\nBecause the companies have already worked together for three years, they expect the merged company to function well.\n"Mergers don\'t always work, but this one will," Vallance added.\nAT&amp;T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular enlarged rival, said it was confident any MCI/British Telecom deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government and called on both U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of the deal on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom\'s home market.\nAlready strong in long distance, MCI hopes to use BT\'s service and back-up expertise, plus plenty of cash, to help take a big chunk of the $100 billion a year U.S. local calling market from the regional Bells.\nThat market is expected to gradually open to competition following legislation earlier this year. Since 1984 it had been the monopoly of the seven regional Bells.\nMCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts said he was confident the combination with British Telecom would win the approval of federal regulators, noting that "the U.K. is the most competitive telecommunications market in the world."\nHe added that the deal would result in lower expenditures for both companies because "costs will be reduced by building networks once, not twice." The companies expect to save $1.5 billion in costs over five years.\nEmployees, usually tense during mergers, can relax.\n"Minimal job cuts, that is the joy of this. MCI will operate in the Americas, and BT will operate in the U.K and the rest of the world," Vallance told Reuters.\nConcert Plc would be one of the world\'s largest telecommunications companies, with 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.\n"The complementary strengths and skills of BT and MCI will enable Concert to take full advantage of the great opportunities provided by the forthcoming liberalization of the telecommunications market in the U.S. and Europe," said Vallance.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, which has yet to be approved by regulatory authorities on either side of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive 0.54 new American Depositary Shares in the new combined group for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one British Telecom American Depositary Share and $6 cash.\nBritish Telecom\'s ADSs closed at $55.50 in New York on Friday, giving a value of $30 per MCI share, plus $6 in cash per share before the effect of a buyback by British Telecom that is part of the deal, MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told Reuters.\nBritish Telecom said Concert will buy back up to 10 percent of its shares after the deal closes. The maximum buyback would increase the value of the deal to MCI shareholders to $39.60 per MCI share. MCI\'s stock closed Friday at $30.25 on Nasdaq.\nThe new company, incorporated in Britain, would have headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the British Telecom and MCI brand names.\nBritish Telecom has been looking for a major acquisition since its proposed merger with British rival Cable and Wireless failed in May. It had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world\'s fastest-growing market.\nAnalysts now expect British Telecom and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan\'s giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.\nBut while seeking an Asian partner, MCI is putting another one on a backburner.\nMCI is to cut its stake in a U.S. satellite venture with Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to 20 percent from 50 percent, and will not increase its stake in Murdoch\'s News Corp as originally expected.\n"It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp)," Roberts told Reuters.\nMCI paid $1.35 billion for a stake of just under 9 percent, and could increase it to 13 percent with another $1 billion investment.\nRoberts added that if U.S. regulatory permission could be obtained, he may even sell the $700 million license that goes with the U.S. direct-to-home broadcast satellite to Murdoch.\n'

a(S'McDonald\'s Corp. said Tuesday it created a new position of chairman of its U.S. operations, in a move analysts said was sparked by intense competition and soft sales from existing stores in the domestic market.\nMcDonald\'s named Jack Greenberg, 54, to the new post of chairman, McDonald\'s U.S.A. He remains vice chairman of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company, but will relinquish the chief financial officer post.\nGreenberg will continue to report to Michael Quinlan, McDonald\'s chairman.\n"The signal they are trying to send is, \'we clearly recognise that we have problems in the U.S. and we are going to do something about it\'," NatWest Securities analyst Damon Brundage said of Greenberg\'s appointment.\nReflecting the mature and intensely competitive U.S. market, analysts said they expected McDonald\'s third-quarter same store sales will be down compared with a year ago. Same store data measure sales from units open at least a year.\n"They have not had a single positive month in the U.S. this year," Brundage said of its same store sales. McDonald\'s does not disclose its same store sales.\n"Margins have been under pressure for over a year in the U.S.," added Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels.\nGreenberg\'s new post indicates that McDonald\'s was not pleased with the direction of its domestic business, Daniels said. "They are trying to shake things up and put a little more focus on being aggressive in responding to the competition," he added.\nThe company has been introducing new offerings such as its Arch Deluxe hamburger earlier this year and the recent launch of Deluxe Grilled Chicken, Fish Filet and Crispy Chicken sandwiches.\nMcDonald\'s said Greenberg\'s appointment was aimed at strengthening U.S. management.\n"While these changes are evolutionary, they will bring more management firepower where we need it, both for the short and long-term," Quinlan said in a statement.\nAs part of the management changes, Edward Rensi, McDonald\'s U.S.A president, will report to Greenberg. But Greenberg was quick to say he and Rensi have a good working relationship.\n"Ed and I are good friends. We work well together. He\'s very enthusiastic about this," Greenberg said in a telephone interview. "We all want this business to do well."\nDespite the pressure in the United States, McDonald\'s international business, which accounts for more than half of its operating income, continues to be strong, analysts said.\n"International is a wide-open growth opportunity for McDonald\'s," Daniels said.\nInternational profit growth is expected to contribute to an expected 12 percent gain in earnings for McDonald\'s overall in the third quarter, according to analyst estimates.\nGiven the intense competition between McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s International Inc. and Grand Metropolitan Plc.\'s Burger King, Greenberg faces a tough job as head of the U.S. operations, analysts said.\n"He is going to parachute into ... what looks to be one of the most challenging operating roles in the U.S. fast-food restaurant business," Brundage said.\nGreenberg, 54, said he believed McDonald\'s was well positioned to compete in the domestic market.\n"We\'ve got more locations than anybody else. We\'ve got the most powerful brand in the world... We\'ve got the largest marketing budget. We\'ve got enormous purchasing power," he added.\nMcDonald\'s operates more than 19,200 restaurants worldwide, including about 12,000 in the United States.\nWhile Greenberg joined McDonald\'s in 1982 as chief financial officer, he said he has field experience with its restaurants. "I spent a year in the field in restaurants and became a regional manager for a year as well," Greenberg said.\nIn other management moves, McDonald\'s also named Michael Conley, currently senior vice president and controller, as chief financial officer, succeeding Greenberg.\n'

a(S'Facing declining U.S. cereal volumes in an intensely competitive market, Kellogg Co said it is launching promotional programs to boost its sales.\n"We\'ll be taking what we believe are appropriate actions," Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said Friday.\nKellogg refused to outline what those programs might include. Analysts said they don\'t expect the cereal giant to return to deep-discount coupons or buy-one, get-one-free promotional giveaways.  \n"It\'s sort of left to speculation what they\'re going to do," SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.\n"There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions," added BT Securities analyst John O\'Neil.\nWhatever form the marketing actions take -- perhaps offering additional modest coupons in Sunday newspaper supplements or some form of price promotion -- the programs will be launched in the current fourth quarter.  \nKellogg, like other major cereal makers, cut cereal prices earlier this year in an effort to attract consumers back to the cereal aisle.\nBut those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz.\n"The message there is that prices have to come down further," Rabinowitz added.\nThe drop in U.S. cereal sales contributed to a decline in third quarter operating earnings of $0.85 a share, before a $0.10 charge, compared with $1.05 last year.  \nKellogg\'s decision to launch promotions follows a decline in its third quarter U.S. cereal sales volume, which analysts estimate at nine to 10 percent.\n"We can\'t detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down," Lovell said.\nKellogg\'s sales volume declined due to intense competition in the United States, as other producers continued coupons and other promotions in a sluggish cereal market. Kellogg said third quarter U.S. cereal industry sales grew 1.5 percent, measuring all retail outlets.\n"As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category," Arnold Langbo, chairman, said in the third-quarter earnings statement.\nAccording to Information Resources data, U.S. ready-to-eat cereal sales in grocery stores only fell 1.6 percent to 2.6 billion pounds for the 52 weeks ended August 11, according to the most recent data available, compared with a year ago.\nKellogg\'s sales volume declined in that period by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4 percent, Information Resources said.\nReuters Chicago Newsdesk - 312-408-8787\n'

a(S'Former Archer Daniels Midland Co executive Mark Whitacre, who acted as an informant in an antitrust case against the company, on Friday filed suit against ADM seeking back wages and punitive damages.\nIn a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, Whitacre also formally denied charges previously brought by ADM that he allegedly stole $9.0 million from the agribusiness company.\n"ADM\'s claim that Whitacre was fired for embezzlement is merely a pretext," the lawsuit says.  \n"Whitacre was in fact fired for assisting the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) with its investigation into ADM," the suit continues.\nLast month, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive and citric acid, which is used in food and beverages. It agreed to pay $100 million in fines, a record for U.S. antitrust cases.\nIn his suit, Whitacre seeks a judgment against ADM of more than $50,000 and punitive damages of more than $50,000. Potential damages, if awarded, could be much greater, perhaps in the tens of millions, sources close to the case said.  \nIn September, Whitacre had said he planned to file an $80 million wrongful discharge suit against ADM.\nLegal experts said it is common practice in suits to seek damages above or below $50,000.\nADM did not respond to requests for comment on the suit.\nIn his suit, Whitacre is claiming lost wages from August, 1995, when he was fired as president of ADM\'s BioProducts Division, until October 1995 when he was hired as chief executive officere of  Biomar International Inc.\nWhitacre earned $320,000 a year at ADM, plus stock options.  \nIn his suit, Whitacre charges ADM with denying him the right to exercise company stock options, defamation of his character and mental and emotional distress.\nWhitacre has admitted to trying to kill himself last year after his role as an FBI mole became known.\nHe also claimed that he was forced to sell his home in the Decatur, Ill., area for only $400,000, even though it had been recently appraised for $1.0 million. Whitacre also said in the suit he had invested about $1.3 million on the home.\nWhitacre is now a resident of Chapel Hill, N.C.\nWhitacre\'s attorneys, Richard Kurth of Kurth &amp; DeArmond of Danville, Ill., and Bill Walker of Granite City, Ill., were not immediately available for comment.\nThe lawsuit was not handled by Chicago attorney James Epstein of the firm Epstein, Zaideman &amp; Esrig, who has been representing Whitacre.

a(S'Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive Mark Whitacre said Tuesday he was no longer cooperating with the U.S. government in its price-fixing probe, adding yet another wrinkle to the complex antitrust case.\nWhitacre, a government informant for about three years in the federal investigation of his former employer, was indicted Tuesday along with two other ex-ADM executives for conspiring to fix prices of the feed additive lysine.\nAlso indicted were Michael Andreas, former executive vice president and vice chairman of ADM, and Terrance Wilson, a former group vice president. Michael Andreas is also the son of ADM Chairman Dwayne Andreas.\n"I have decided not to participate in the government\'s coverup any longer," Whitacre told Reuters.\nAsked to comment on the indictment against him, Whitacre said, "I have no comment other than when all the evidence comes out in this case, the only people that will have questions yet to answer will be the Justice Department and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) itself."\nThe Justice Department did not respond to Whitacre\'s statement.\nLegal experts said it was common for federal informants and cooperative witnesses to be indicted, though they often receive lenient treatment and light sentences in return for their cooperation.\n"If the informant got too good a deal, it would diminish his credibility," said James Shapiro, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Chicago who has no direct knowledge of the case involving ADM and Whitacre.\nWhitacre\'s decision to stop cooperating with the government could jeopardise his treatment by the Justice Department. But antitrust attorney Champ Davis of the Chicago firm Davis, Mannix and McGrath, said Whitacre\'s previous cooperation could still be taken into consideration.\n"He can argue, I think, that he was cooperative up to a point," said Davis, who is not involved in the ADM case. "(That) is a factor that ought to be taken into account."\nBy no longer cooperating -- and presumably not agreeing to testify on behalf of the government in upcoming trials against the defendants -- Whitacre could weaken the government\'s case somewhat, legal experts said.\n"It would weaken the government\'s case (against Michael Andreas and Wilson) to some extent, not to have the guy who made the tapes to interpret them," Shapiro said.\nWhile he was cooperating with federal investigators, Whitacre had said that he made hundreds of tape recordings of ADM executives allegedly in price-fixing discussions.\nBut the government\'s case was unlikely to be derailed since the tapes still could be used, Shapiro said.\nIn October, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products. ADM also agreed to pay a $100 million fine.\nA lawsuit Whitacre filed against his former employer in November stated that the government\'s case against ADM was based "in large part upon the information obtained from Whitacre."\nWhitacre gave no further reasons for his decision to stop cooperating with the government. But he has been involved in several legal tangles since the ADM price-fixing probe first came to light in June 1995.\nIn August 1995, ADM fired Whitacre, who had been head of its BioProducts division, for allegedly stealing $9 million from the company. Whitacre has denied those charges, saying the money allegedly involved off-the-books bonuses that he received that were approved by company management.\nADM has sued Whitacre over the $9 million. Whitacre filed a wrongful dismissal suit last month against ADM.\nThe Justice Department has been conducting a separate investigation into the money that Whitacre received and allegations of off-the-books payments by ADM.\n'

a(S'Oneok Inc. and Western Resources Inc. on Thursday agreed to a $660 million deal that combines their natural gas assets and gives Western Resources access to a broader base of customers for its electricity and security services.\nThe deal reflects the moves within the utility industry to prepare for further deregulation.\nUnder the agreement, Oneok will take all the natural gas assets of Western Resources, making it the ninth largest gas distribution company in the United States serving 1.4 million customers. Tulsa-based Oneok is the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co.\nWestern Resources, based in Topeka, Kan., will become the largest equity holder in Oneok, receiving about 3 million new shares of Oneok common stock and preferred stock that will be convertible, upon necessary regulatory approvals, into about another 19.3 million shares of Oneok common. Its total stake in Oneok is about 45 percent.\nThe deal is expected to close by mid-1997, following approval by Oneok shareholders and federal and state regulatory authorities.\n"They (Oneok) are a total gas company. They understand the gas business better than we do," Western Resources president David Wittig said in a telephone interview.\nBy swapping its gas assets, Western Resources will be able to focus its efforts on growing its electricity and home-security businesses, both of which involve a customer base of home owners and 24-hour monitoring of consumers.\nOneok\'s 735,000 customers could become potential clients of Western Resources\' services.\n"Western Rseources has been becoming a nationwide marketer of retail energy -- electricity and/or gas -- and home security," Everen Securities analyst Dan Rudakas said. "This combination gives them direct access to another 735,000 gas customers, which in the future ... would be potential electric customers and also electronic home security customers."\nThe companies said the alliance will position the companies to take advantage of the expected deregulation of the electricity industry, allowing customers to buy electrical power from several sources instead of just the local utility. That type of deregulation is already taking place in the natural gas industry.\n"Eventuallly there will be total competition in electricity and in gas," John Hayes Jr, Western Resources chairman, told a teleconference. "We are just preparing for the future."\nThe companies said Oneok\'s independence would be preserved by standstill provisions in the agreement that define the rights and responsibilities of the respective companies for at least the next 15 years.\nWestern Resources will receive a preferred dividend of 1.5 times the underlying common dividend, which now stands at 30 cents a share, but no less than $1.80 per preferred share per year for the first five years.\nGeorge K. Baum analyst Dennis Hudson said Western Resources\' natural gas assets earned that company about $20 million in 1995. As part of Oneok, the assets likely will earn more, given that company\'s expertise in gas distributions and synergies from its existing gas business.\nWith its stake in Oneok, Western Resources will still benefit from a portion of the gas earnings, as well as future gas alliances that Oneok might enter into in the future.\n"Oneok would continue to search for opportunities to acquire more customers on the gas side. We\'re most supportive of that," Wittig said.\nHe added that Western Resources continues to look for ways to expand its electricity and home-security businesses.\n((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))\n'

a(S'British Governor Chris Patten challenged business on Thursday to defend the rule of law that had made Hong Kong a success, and to destroy fallacies that may harm the territory in the run-up to China\'s mid-1997 takeover.\n"The rule of law is not an optional extra. It is what makes Hong Kong different, it is what makes Hong Kong successful," Patten told the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in a speech.\n"Without it, a lot of you would not be here," he said.\nBritain hands back Hong Kong to China in 264 days from now, ending a century and a half of colonial rule over an outpost that has become one of Asia\'s economic pearls.\nChina has promised Hong Kong substantial autonomy and the preservation of its capitalist system under a "one country, two systems" formula.\nPatten and chamber chairman James Tien glossed over an image projected in local newspapers lately that the governor and the business community were at loggerheads over 1997-related issues.\nSeveral times this year Patten chastised businessmen who pandered to Beijing\'s communist rulers to beg favours and thus invited China to encroach upon Hong Kong\'s autonomy.\nTien stressed at Thursday\'s gathering that the key business body backed the government on key policies. Patten thanked them, drawing applause, and said his critics were in a minority.\nTien said the chamber supported the pegging of Hong Kong\'s currency to the U.S. dollar, the rule of law, the independence of judges and the civil service, and the commitment to good government.\nBut he did not mention Britain\'s demand for Hong Kong\'s fully elected legislature to continue after the 1997 handover, a major plank of Patten\'s policy, or China\'s plans to scrap this legislature and replace it with an appointed "provisional" body.\nAsked by one businessman if there were any conditions under which Patten would cooperate with the "provisional legislature", the governor flatly replied "No".\nPatten stressed the value of a political opposition. He cited a poll in which three-quarters of executives questioned said opposition to government posed no threat to a territory\'s prospects and that Hong Kong\'s opposition was in fact too weak.\n"I\'m very grateful to the chamber for everything they\'ve been doing to redress the balance," he said, drawing guffaws of laughter for his ironic reference to barbs that he has received from some local business leaders in recent months.\nPatten exhorted business to speak out for Hong Kong\'s autonomy, opposition to corruption, and for basic freedoms. He also asked it to help destroy four big fallacies that he said harmed Hong Kong\'s prospects and image.\nThese were the notions that Hong Kong\'s economy needed stimulative intervention, that it was over-regulated and was losing its competitive edge, that welfare spending was too high, and that the rule of law was irrelevant to economic success.\n"You can give Hong Kong a lead in defending the rule of law, open and accountable government... by helping to nail the fallacies I have described. When you speak up for Hong Kong, it makes a difference," Patten said.\nThe fact that over half the companies listed on the Hong Kong bourse had domiciles in places such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, he said, showed the value the business community attached to the rule of law.\nIn recent years many firms have hedged their 1997 risks by shifting their legal domiciles to overseas jurisdictions.\n'

a(S'As U.S. President Bill Clinton jumped into Asian foreign policy issues with a new enthusiasm on Wednesday, security experts meeting in Hong Kong called on all countries involved to ensure no conflict flared up over Taiwan.\nExperts said U.S. policy on China and Asia was maturing, and they called for the status quo in Taiwan to continue in the interests of wider Asia-Pacific security and prosperity.\n"Next to Korea, the Taiwan Strait is the second major potential security flashpoint in the region," David Shambaugh of the George Washington University in the United States said.\n"This is not a back-burner issue. It can quickly ignite and get on to the front burner... It is an issue we have to keep our eye on," he said, adding that any flareup over Taiwan would severely damage the region\'s bustling commerce.\nShambaugh was talking at a discussion panel of security experts at the World Economic Forum\'s Europe/East Asia meeting.\nHe said Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui and other Taiwan leaders should restrain themselves and that the time would be riper for dialogue with Beijing after China holds a watershed Communist Party congress next year.\nAt the same time, China should renounce the use of force and coercive diplomacy towards Taiwan and respect Taiwan\'s autonomy within a "one-China" formula. China should not expect Taipei "to negotiate with a gun to its head", Shambaugh said.\nChina-Taiwan relations have been tense over the past two years as pro-independence sentiment grew in Taiwan and Beijing launched a drive for the reintegration of its lost territories.\nTaiwan, historically part of China, has been separated from the mainland for most of the past century, first by 50 years of Japanese occupation, then when China\'s nationalist government lost a civil war to the communists in 1949 and fled to Taipei.\nChina regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has threatened to use force if the island seeks formal independence.\nIn March this year, as Taiwan went to the polls, a major crisis blew up when China launched missile tests and briefly blockaded Taiwan to deter Taipei from declaring independence.\n"We should maintain the status quo," Yuan Ming, a strategic studies expert from Beijing University, said on Wednesday.\nThe view was echoed by Masashi Nishihara from Japan\'s National Defence Academy, who said Taiwan should not provoke China by seeking a United Nations seat.\nAnother expert, Gerald Segal of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the United States successfully defended the strategic balance and at the same time managed to stop short of a conflict when it sent two aircraft carriers into seas near Taiwan as a warning to China during the March crisis.\nBut he warned that the arms race in the region, where many governments were newly democratic but politically very fragile, threatened stability.\nVisiting Australia on Wednesday, Clinton said the United States was more determined than ever to be involved in Asia, to help provide stability, that China should not be isolated and that engaging Beijing was a "big priority".\nAt the same time Secretary of State Warren Christopher was in Beijing shoring up relations. Clinton is to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin at next week\'s summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines.\nShambaugh said the flurry of high-level contacts now and in the near future between Beijing and Washington was important for building the Sino-U.S. relationship.\nBut he said Chinese officials would remain suspicious that the United States had a "subversion agenda" for China and that the policy of engagement was actually an attempt at containment.\n'

a(S'Just months ago, shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa was a retiring man who avoided the limelight, kept his political views secret, and seemed to steer an even keel between his loyalties to China and Britain.\nBut in a short time, he has emerged as the hot favourite to become Hong Kong\'s first post-colonial leader and evolved into a tough-talking conservative, loudly singing China\'s tune on key political issues, under the bright spotlight of the media.\nThe 59-year-old tycoon with hallmark spiky grey hair has been swapping his pinstripe suits for jeans and sportswear to traipse around local communities to show he not only walks among kings but also has the common touch.\nTung, 59, saw his fortunes almost dashed in the 1980s when the family company met ill winds, but Beijing helped bail him out with a syndicated loan, and now he is poised to be their man in Hong Kong.\nOn Wednesday, China\'s carefully screened Selection Committee will choose the chief executive to run Hong Kong after Britain hands its last important colony back to Beijing in mid-1997.\nTung is streets ahead of his rivals, having run away with 206 of the 400 votes in the first round of balloting.\nBehind him are retired chief judge Yang Ti Liang, who scored 82, and businessman Peter Woo, who clocked up 54.\nA poll last week for the first time made Tung the public\'s favourite -- 47 percent support versus Yang\'s 29 -- although the masses are excluded from voting for their future leader.\nThere is hardly a voice that does not pronounce Tung the predetermined winner. A pointed handshake from President Jiang Zemin in Beijing last January anointed Tung, most people think.\nSince he declared his candidacy two months ago Tung has said he would legalise the Communist party, condemned the Democratic Party -- Hong Kong\'s largest -- for being anti-China, and warned foreign countries not to use Hong Kong to subvert China.\nHe also said anybody advocating independence for Taiwan or Tibet could not stay.\nHe has accused colonial Governor Chris Patten of trying to split Hong Kong, called for pro-China patriotism in the schools, and unveiled administrative polices stressing executive-led rule and a slower route to democracy.\nLast week Tung rounded on those who use the term "pro-China" as a dirty word. "We have to turn pro-China into a very positive definition. It is a good thing to love our country," he said.\n"I find him more colonial than the colonial government," complained Democratic Party legislator Tsang Kin-shing.\nTung has vowed to give free rein to Hong Kong\'s capitalist economy and business development. But he has also promised to boost the role of provident funds, guarantee welfare for the poor, and make cheap housing available.\nWhile some fret over his conservatism, most who know him both at home and abroad hail Tung\'s good character. He has a reputation for modesty, wisdom and caution.\n"He is a man, in my view, of great integrity, a strong individual, independent-minded, surely and sincerely promoting the welfare of the people of Hong Kong," said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, a friend of Tung\'s.\nBut Lord noted he had failed to sway Tung to reject China\'s plan to scrap Hong Kong\'s elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature next July 1. Britain has condemned the plan as a "black day for democracy" in the territory.\nTung has been a senior member of a Preparatory Committee of pro-Beijing Hong Kong notables and mainland China officials crafting the power structures to replace British colonial rule.\nHe was lauded as an impartial and honest counsellor by Patten when Tung left Patten\'s advisory cabinet in June.\nHe resigned in October as head of his firm, Orient Overseas (International) Ltd, to make his leadership bid.\nTung took the helm of Orient after his father died in 1979. He has publicly acknowledged China had helped bail out the firm 11 years ago by backing a US$120 million fund led by tycoon Henry Fok, a kingmaker in today\'s leadership contest.\nTung is believed to be liked in Britain and by many business leaders who hope he will form a "dream team" with incumbent Chief Secretary Anson Chan -- Hong Kong\'s top civil servant.\nBorn in Shanghai in 1937, Tung was educated at Liverpool University in Britain.\n'

a(S'More than 100 politicians, including half of today\'s lawmakers, have sought seats on a controversial Beijing-controlled legislature in a move that may cripple Hong Kong\'s parliament in the twilight of British rule.\nBefore a registration deadline on Monday, 112 people had applied to join the "provisional legislature", among them 33 members of the present elected Legislative Council (Legco).\nHong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30, and Beijing is pressing ahead -- despite British objections -- on setting up a provisional interim legislature to replace the elected Legco at the handover.\nThe provisional legislature will be selected on December 21.\nThe territory of 6.3 million people now faces a bizarre prospect of having two legislatures for the final six months of British rule -- one elected, legal and active, and a shadow "selected" chamber vulnerable to courtroom battles.\nThe number of seats on Legco and the new body is the same -- 60. An official of the China-controlled committee supervising the three-week registration process said 217 people had requested application forms, so there could be more contenders at the last minute.\nAmong 33 incumbent lawmakers who have applied are Legco speaker Andrew Wong, whose bid startled the political community last weekend and sparked fears that Legco could disintegrate.\n"Cracks which have already emerged within the Legislative Council over the bid by some members for a seat on the provisional legislature will widen in the next six months," said political commentator Chris Yeung.\n"When you have two bodies from which laws emanate at the same time, there\'s going to be some confusion and dispute," said analyst Michael DeGolyer of Hong Kong\'s Baptist University.\nThose wanting a seat in the new chamber also include 11 ex-lawmakers and 22 former election contestants defeated in 1995 elections in which pro-democracy groups led by the Democratic Party fared strongly.\nThe 1995 losers applying for a seat include prominent pro-Beijing politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Peggy Lam and Elsie Tu.\nApplicants also include 47 newcomers to legislative contests, many of whom are members of the hand-picked 150-member Preparatory Committee crafting the post-1997 Hong Kong power structures on behalf of China\'s communist rulers.\nOther newcomers are members of the 400-strong Selection Committee. This is the China-backed panel that will chose the first post-colonial leader on Wednesday, with the winner forecast to be conservative-minded shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa. The committee will also be responsible for selecting the provisional legislative body on December 21.\nAn opinion poll published on Monday by the independent daily Ming Pao showed Hong Kong people split over the legitimacy of the provisional legislature.\nThe poll showed 32 percent supporting the body, 30 percent against, and 38 percent voicing no opinion. A sample of 983 respondents were surveyed by telephone for the poll.\nThe Democratic Party, the largest in the Legco with 19 seats, are absent from all China-controlled transition bodies.\nThey have boycotted the selection process, branding the provisional legislature as undemocratic and illegal, and have vowed to challenge its legitimacy in the courts.\nThe threat has forced Beijing\'s representatives in Hong Kong to consider locating the interim legislature in mainland China in the transitional period.\nBritain has condemned China\'s plan as reprehensible and unnecessary and has ruled out all cooperation with the body.\n'

a(S'French state-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale, in the throes of merger talks, faces key questions on its strategic operations as Europe\'s aircraft industry gears up for competition with a new U.S. giant.\nAerospatiale is due to merge with combat plane maker Dassault Aviation as part of France\'s consolidation of its fragmented defence industry.\nIt is also fighting what executives see as a rearguard action to preserve its hold on building passenger jets for Airbus Industrie, in which it is a senior partner.\n"France and Europe have no choice but to restructure," Jean-Marc Baron, aerospace specialist at consultancy KPMG Peat Marwick, said. "The Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger is excellent because it confronts the Europeans with reality."\nSunday\'s surprise merger announcement by U.S. giant Boeing and McDonnell Douglas put the spotlight on speeding up European consolidation and a shakeup of the Airbus structure, in which Aerospatiale is expected to play a key role.\nAirbus partners British Aerospace Plc (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa) are pushing for a version of a future Airbus which could effectively take commercial aircraft production out of Aerospatiale\'s hands.\nThe Airbus shareholders, which also include Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain (Casa), are negotiating the future shape of the Airbus group as part of a move to convert it to a joint stock company from a cumbersome partnership structure.\nIf, as the British and Germans want, the partners transfer key design and manufacturing assets to Airbus, Aerospatiale would be left with an uncertain future in missiles, satellites, helicopters and combat aircraft after taking over Dassault, a senior industry executive said.\n"Aerospatiale wants to accelerate the merger with Dassault to give it more weight vis-a-vis Dasa in Airbus," Baron said.\nAerospatiale derives 70 percent of annual sales from the civilian sector, of which half comes from Airbus products, an Aerospatiale spokeswoman said.\nAirbus contributed a 1995 operating profit of 1.06 billion francs ($203 million) to Aerospatiale and that figure is sure to rise for this year with Airbus deliveries at 111 at the end of November. Airbus delivered 102 planes in 1995.\nAlthough Aerospatiale, which had 1995 turnover of 49.23 billion francs, would absorb Dassault in the merger, chairman Serge Dassault has said he wants to keep its identity distinct.\nDassault, smaller than Aerospatiale with 1995 sales of 11.6 billion francs, has consistently made profits and cultivates its own strong corporate culture as maker of the Mirage combat plane and Falcon small business jet.\nThe merged company would have annual turnover of around 60 billion francs and is expected to have a common purchasing centre. Purchasing makes up around 60 percent of turnover so if it made annual savings of around five percent, it could benefit to the tune of one to two billion francs a year.\nThe Aerospatiale spokeswoman said merger terms had not yet been agreed.\nAerospatiale wants Airbus eventually to have a military wing, similar to U.S. giants such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, a source close to the company said.\nThe U.S. giants have defence businesses to balance out the business cycles and receive state research contracts for military projects which are viewed as indirect industry aid.\nAfter merging with Dassault and breaking even, Aerospatiale can be privatised. This is expected to be a sale of capital to industrial partners rather than a stock market flotation, because of the strategic nature of Aerospatiale\'s business.\nBut so far, no timetable or partners have emerged.\nOn missiles and satellites, Aerospatiale executives are frustrated that they have been unable to close a deal to merge these activities with Dasa, despite years of negotiations.\nThe two activities, grouped under a space and defence heading, contributed 412 million francs operating profit in 1995, after a loss of 32 million in 1994.\nMeanwhile, it feels the French conglomerate Lagardere Groupe breathing down its neck. Lagardere recently completed a merger of its Matra missiles unit with BAe to create the Matra BAe Dynamics joint venture, with annual sales of $1.5 billion.\nLagardere argues that by virtue of its British merger it should be the focus for the next consolidation between France and Germany in missiles, while its Matra Marconi Space satellites joint venture with Britain\'s GEC Plc should be the centre of a European space business.\nAerospatiale also has a Eurocopter joint venture with Dasa, which makes military and civilian helicopters. Eurocopter made an operating loss of 817 million francs last year, after a 45 million loss in the previous year.\nEurocopter faces a difficult medium-term outlook with an orders gap after the next two years until first deliveries in 2002 of the Tiger combat helicopter to the French army.\nAerospatiale made its first surplus since 1991 with a first-half 1996 net profit of 273 million francs and expects to break even in 1997 if the dollar stays at five francs.\nIt made a 1995 net attributable loss of 981 million, due to a 1.5 billion restructuring charge to cover 3,000 job losses.

The stock dropped $3 after the transaction was announced on Tuesday.\nWall Street analysts said the deal was strategically sound from a long-term perspective, but noted that investors were wary of the company\'s shift into a new area.\n"The scepticism, which we don\'t share, is related to the company\'s going into a business outside their consolidation within the ambulance industry," said Randall Huyser of Furman Selz.\nHouston-based STAT Healthcare provides staffing for hospital emergency rooms. It also offers outpatient medical services such as kidney dialysis.\nIndustry sources also cited the company\'s prediction the deal will slightly dilute earnings this year.\nIn a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, American Medical Response said the transaction will add to earnings in 1997. It also anticipated cost savings of $2.5 million from the merger.\nIndustry analysts noted that the acquisition marked a logical extension of its existing services by branching out into the hospital emergency room and providing more services for clients.\n"They\'re taking it beyond just driving you to the hospital," said Clifford Hewitt of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co Inc.\nIndustry sources also noted that shareholders of STAT Healthcare were likely to be concerned about the steep stock decline because the transaction was not based on any fixed price for American Medical Response shares. The deal calls for each share of STAT common stock to be converted into one-quarter share of American Medical Response.\nOfficials from both companies could not be reached for comment.\nSTAT stock fell 87.5 cents to $7.375 on Nasdaq.\nAnalysts expect American Medical Response to continue its tradition of buying ambulance companies as it works to integrate the STAT acquisition.\n"I think the outlook for this company is very good. There are 12,000 ambulance companies in the U.S. and they aren\'t geared to the needs of medical care as it is evolving," said Hewitt.\n'

a(S'CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. said Monday they had entered discussions about their rival offers to buy Conrail Inc.\nThe two railroads did not disclose the specific nature of their talks, but Conrail\'s stock fell on views that the discussions would dampen the prospects of a bidding war for the Philadelphia-based railroad.\nA source familiar with the companies said the discussions began late last week, continued through the weekend and into Monday.\nRichmond, Va.-based CSX last month struck an agreement to buy Conrail in a $8.4 billion cash and stock transaction that valued Conrail at $92.50 per share. Norfolk Southern soon launched its own bid of $100 cash per share, or about $9 billion.\nSince then, the two companies have been locked in a fight over their rival offers and taken the matter to court.\nCSX, which said Norfolk Southern initiated the talks, said the discussions concerned "a possible sale by the post-merger CSX/Conrail of certain material assets."\nMeanwhile, Norfolk Southern sought to quell speculation that it would abandon its bid for Conrail, saying that it was committed to its offer and has secured more than $15 billion to finance the proposed acquisition.\nNorfolk Southern said the talks were started by CSX, adding that they were aimed at promoting competition.\n"Our willingness to talk to CSX at its suggestion is consistent with my previously announced position that Conrail cannot be acquired by either CSX or NS without a plan to maintain a balanced competitive structure for Eastern railroad service. While I am heartened by CSX\'s willingness to discuss these matters, we have no reason to believe that Conrail is prepared to accept that reality," said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode (corrects from Dean Goode).\nA battle for Conrail is viewed as being rife with difficulties for all the companies. Although Norfolk Southern has a higher offer on the table, analysts have said that Pennsylvania\'s corporate takeover law could be an obstacle to its proposed acquisition.\n"This is not a good time to be having a long, drawn-out fight. The quicker they get to this, the better," said analyst Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.\nConrail shares had partly recovered from the early steep fall by afternoon, trading down $2 per share at $92.25 on NYSE. CSX rose $1.625 to $44.625 and Norfolk Southern gained $1.125 to $90.50, also on the NYSE.\n'

a(S'Mattel Inc., seeking to expand in the market for boys\' toys, agreed to buy third-ranked Tyco Toys Inc. for $755 million, the companies said Monday.\nThe proposed union will combine Mattel\'s Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels miniature cars and Fisher-Price toys with Tyco\'s Matchbox cars, Sesame Street toys and radio-controlled vehicles.\n"We really believe that the boys\' toy business is a very important one. We have never had big market share in that category," Mattel President Jill Barad said in a telephone interview.\nUnder the agreement, Tyco shareholders will receive Mattel stock valued at $12.50 per Tyco share, representing a 78 percent premium above Friday\'s closing price for Tyco stock.\nShares of Tyco jumped $4.50 to $11.50, while Mattel fell 75 cents to $29.875, both on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe proposed transaction follows Mattel\'s unsuccessful effort earlier this year to acquire No. 2 rival Hasbro Inc. Mattel, the nation\'s largest toymaker, was forced to withdraw its unwelcome bid due to widespread concern about its effect on competition.\nMattel said the Tyco transaction was expected to be completed in the fist half of 1997 and would add to its earnings in the first year. The boards of both companies have approved the merger.\nThe proposed transaction followed discussions that began with a Sept. 29 meeting between Barad and Tyco Chief Executive Officer Gary Baughman. Representatives of both companies met again on Oct. 14.\nIndustry experts said the proposed acquisition will accomplish many of the same goals for Mattel as the failed Hasbro transaction.\n"It\'s been something they have been trying to do for years and years," said Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick of Mattel\'s desire to boost its presence in boys\' markets.\n"The outstanding worldwide potential for Tyco\'s well-known brands will be fully realised through this merger with Mattel," Mattel Chairman John Amerman said in a statement.\nAlthough the union will combine two of the nation\'s biggest toymakers, Barad said antitrust issues were not expected to be significant. She noted that the combined companies will hold less than 20 percent market share in the highly fragmented industry.\n"The market shares are still low even when you look at the category breakdowns," she said in a telephone interview.\nTyco, based in Mt. Laurel, N.J., had 1995 revenues of $709 million. Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., had 1995 sales $3.6 billion. No. 2 toy maker Hasbro had 1995 sales of $2.8 billion.\nBut some analysts cited concern about antitrust implications, citing potential market overlap of Mattel\'s Hot Wheels and Tyco\'s Matchbox units, two leading miniature car brands.\n"I think it\'s going to be a long process in getting the OK of regulators. After the Hasbro debacle, anything Mattel does at this point will be looked at by the regulators," said one analyst who did not want to be identified.\nFor money-losing Tyco, the acquisition will represent the culmination of its turnaround efforts. The toymaker last year cut 10 percent of its work force as part of a restructuring aimed at returning to profitability.\nWith its deep pockets, leading market presence and long global reach, Mattel would easily capitalise on Tyco\'s products, analysts said.\n"Mattel clearly has ways to enhance the revenue growth of Tyco and expand it internationally. Mattel is getting into a fairly cleaned-up situation," Smith Barney\'s Krutick said.\nThe proposed combination will also strengthen Mattel\'s position in plush toys, where Tyco is a market leader.\nBarad said the deal includes a fee of $40 million that would be payable to Mattel if another company lured Tyco with a higher bid. It also calls for a break-up fee of $15 million if the transaction is not completed within a year.\nBarad declined to specify anticipated cost savings associated with the deal, saying, "There are a lot and they cover many categories." She also said it was too early to assess the potential impact of the deal on Tyco\'s work force.\n'

a(S'Diamond Shamrock Inc said it plans to close its merger with Ultramar Corp on December 3 and announce a new organizational structure shortly thereafter.\nIn a meeting with security analysts, chief executive officer Roger Hemminghaus said Diamond Shamrock is close to the sale of its telecommunications business and its natural gas exploration and production operations in Bolivia.\nHemminghaus also said that the new Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp will eagerly scour the industry for refining and marketing acquisitions and joint ventures.  \n"There are bound to be some opportunities that are out there for us," Hemminghaus said.\nDiamond Shamrock and Ultramar announced in September a merger that will create a new company with a combined equity value of more than $2.3 billion.  Hemminghaus, who will become chairman and chief executive of the new company, noted that opportunities will come from consolidation occuring elsewhere in the energy industry.  He noted a combination being discussed by Texaco Inc and Royal Dutch/Shell Group\'s Shell Oil Co "means there are going to be some quality assets that become available in certain markets."\nAsked whether his new company would be interested in a joint venture similar to others taking place in the industry, Hemminghaus said "You bet we would".\nHe flatly dismissed speculation that Diamond Shamrock entered the pact with Ultramar because it was being targeted as an acquisition candidate.\n"This was in no way a defensive move on our part," he said, adding Diamond Shamrock was not approached by another firm.  He also said Diamond Shamrock had considered a transaction with Unocal Corp, which on Monday announced the sale of downstream assets to Tosco Corp.\n"Had this deal (Ultramar) not gone through, we would have been looking very seriously at this (Unocal) opportunity.  If the timing had been a little bit different, we would have been out there looking at it," he said.\nDiamond Shamrock anticipates the union with Ultramar will result in cost savings and synergies that will add $0.20 per share to earnings in 1997 and $0.60 per share in 1998.\nThe merger with Ultramar marks the second major transaction for Diamond Shamrock since last December, when it bought National Convenience Stores Inc.\nHemminghaus said cost savings of that transaction have exceeded preliminary estimates.  Savings this year are expected to be $31.5 million compared with earlier estimates of $20 million and estimated savings for 1997 are now set at $46.5 million, he said.\n'

a(S'Ashland Inc has quashed a threatened proxy fight by restucturing its core business, but the independent refiner must still prove its ability to prosper in an industry plagued by poor profit margins.\nA series of actions unveiled Monday by Ashland was viewed as a significant step to convince investors that management will not stand by and watch profits erode.\n"The question now is whether they can deliver. I think there will be more to come," said James Falvey, analyst at Smith Barney.  \nAshland earlier announced a series of steps aimed at enhancing profitability. They included a restructuring of business units, a share buyback program, the evaluation of strategic alternatives for its non-core exploration unit, and a program to evaluate and cut costs.\nThe Kentucky-based refiner has recently been pressured by a New York investment firm that had nominated a three-person slate for election to the company\'s board of directors at the January 30 annual meeting.\nIn announcing the restructuring on Monday, Ashland also announced Providence Capital Inc had withdrawn its slate.  \n"They have addressed all the major issues we raised. We feel the plan is genuine and that they are sincere about defining a new era at Ashland," Herbert Denton, president of Providence Capital, told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nDenton said representatives of Ashland met with Providence last week. Ashland also recently has met with institutional investors.\nAlthough shares of Ashland showed little reaction to Monday\'s plan, analysts noted the stock has risen about $10 per share since September on views of a restructuring. The stock was trading unchanged at 46-5/8 in afternoon trading.  \nAnalysts widely expect Ashland to sell the exploration unit and participate in widespread consolidation taking place throughout the industry. The company did not disclose any cost-cutting targets or timeframe to implement the actions.\nBut analysts said the restructuring is a solid reflection on company veteran and chief executive officer Paul Chellgren, who is set to move into the role of chairman to replace retiring John Hall.\n"I think this is positive. This is a quicker-than-expected start on restructuring," said Fred Leuffer of Bear Stearns &amp; Co, who values the exploration unit at $425 to $450 million.\nAnalysts also said that the restructuring is likely to be an evolutionary process.\n"It\'s not going to happen tomorrow. The results will prove themselves over time and if they don\'t, there will be further initiatives," said Barry Sahgal of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.\nMeanwhile, Denton said his group will continue to monitor the company\'s progress.\n'

a(S'An independent shareholder advisory firm recommended Thursday that investors of Conrail Inc. reject a key provision in the railroad\'s proposed acquisition by CSX Corp.\nMaryland-based Institutional Shareholder Services, which provides corporate analyses to institutional clients, suggested that shareholders defeat a proposal that would permit CSX to pursue its proposed $8.5 billion stock and cash transaction.\nIn making the recommendation, senior analyst Peter Gleason noted Norfolk Southern Corp.\'s rival $10 billion cash bid that has been rejected by Conrail.\n"We believe that all shareholders should be treated equally in any merger transaction, and because of NS\'s higher offer currently outstanding, we do not believe it would be in shareholders\' best interest to opt out of the fair price provision at this time," Gleason wrote in a 16-page report.\nConrail investors are being asked to waive a Pennsylvania law that requires an all-cash payment by CSX, which already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer.\nIn October, CSX and Conrail announced a merger that calls for CSX to buy Conrail in a cash-and-stock deal.\nCSX is offering to pay $110 in cash for 40 percent of Conrail\'s outstanding shares. Based on Thursday\'s closing stock prices, the remaining 60 percent would be bought for about $83 per share.\nAlthough Norfolk Southern has submitted a higher all-cash bid, Conrail contends the CSX offer is a better fit.\nInstitutional Shareholder Services disputed that argument, saying that both potential combinations would create an East Coast railroad powerhouse.\n"However, CSX\'s front-end loaded, two-tiered takeover does not treat all Conrail shareholders fairly, and the lock-ups provided in the agreement have denied Conrail shareholders the possibility of accepting a higher payment for their shares," Gleason wrote.\nUnder the agreement between Conrail and CSX, Conrail would be prohibited from entering a pact with another company before July 1997.\n"The only thing prohibiting the higher offer from being presented to sharheolders are the barriers erected by Conrail to ensure the company merges with CSX," Gleason wrote.\nCSX declined to comment on the report. Conrail also did not have any immediate comment.\nConrail has scheduled a special shareholder meeting for Dec. 23 to consider a waiver of the Pennsylvania law.\nInstitutional Shareholder Services, which held meetings with Conrail and Norfolk Southern, also recommended that shareholders reject a Conrail request to adjourn the meeting if more votes are needed to ensure passage of the waiver.\n"In this case, shareholders already have the information they need to make their voting decisions. Once their votes have been cast, there is no justification to spend extra money to continue pressing shareholders for more votes," Gleason wrote.\nThe shareholder advisory firm also said the Conrail-CSX union could run into trouble from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads.\n"Although Conrail and CSX believe STB approval and/or concessions will not create significant problems, we see the competitive issues as a major concern, and do not share Conrail\'s belief that STB approval of the transaction is assured," Gleason wrote.\nHe also noted that many shareholders expect CSX and Conrail to amend their pact to sweeten the stock portion of their proposed transaction.\n"Conrail has indicated that it has had discussions with CSX about raising the back end of the consideration to make the offer more equitable to shareholders, but no decisions have been made to date," Gleason wrote.\nHe also noted that Norfolk Southern would likely raise its rival offer if CSX sweetened its deal.\nSeparately on Thursday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it planned to intervene in any Conrail merger and would hire a consultant to analyse the impact of any transaction.\n'

a(S'The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court Thursday to lift a lower court suspension of landmark federal rules aimed at prying open the nation\'s local telephone monopolies to competition.\nThe department, acting on behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, said the lower court\'s "stay"  could hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of full-fledged competition in the $100 billion market.\nThe request comes after a U.S. appeals court based in St. Louis last week suspended key provisions of the FCC\'s "interconnection" order, which spells out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others could operate in the local phone market under the new telecommunications law.\nThe rules were frozen while the appeals court considers a challenge to the FCC order by GTE Corp., the so-called Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators who want the measure overturned.\nThey argue the FCC overstepped the power granted to it by Congress. The FCC, among other things, ordered the regional Bells and other local phone companies to lease their lines to new rivals at discounts of 17 percent to 25 percent.\nThe three-judge appeals court panel said the opponents "have a better than even chance of convincing the court" that the FCC\'s rules conflicted with the law.\nBut the Justice Department told the high court the appeals court action "already imperils" the timetable set by Congress for opening the local phone market.\n"The stay draws into question not just the timing of competition in the local market, but also the timing of full entry by the Bell companies into the long-distance telephone market," the department added.\nLong-distance carriers AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., among other companies, also asked the high court on Thursday to lift the stay.\nLawyers were divided over the likely outcome.\n"They have a decent shot at lifting the stay," said Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. He noted the FCC\'s success last year in having Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens lift a lower court stay that had blocked a major FCC airwave auction.\nBut others were less sure. "It\'s very difficult to predict," said Nicholas Allard of Latham &amp; Watkins.\nThe Justice Department request, along with those of the long-distance companies, is expected to go to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees matters related to the St. Louis-based appeals court.\nThomas could refer the request to the full court for its consideration.\n'

a(S'Television and Hollywood moguls on Thursday formally unveiled their controversial system to rate TV programmes, ushering in a new era meant to enable parents to control their kids\' viewing habits better.\nBroadcast and cable-TV networks will begin displaying the six ratings categories at the start of shows as soon as Jan. 2. The ratings will appear briefly as a small icon in the upper left-hand corner of the TV screen.\nThe age-based system is similar to the 28-year-old motion-picture industry ratings and will apply to nearly all shows, including cartoons and talk shows. News and sports programmes will be exempted.\nPresident Bill Clinton, appearing in the Oval Office with leading TV and Hollywood executives, called the new ratings a "huge step forward over what we have now, which is nothing."\nWhile not endorsing the system, Clinton said the ratings "are going to give America\'s families more help in choosing appropriate television programming for their children."\nEven before its unveiling, the system had drawn flak from lawmakers, parent groups, children\'s advocates, educators and others. They want the ratings content-based, specifying the level of sex, violence and strong language.\nThe ratings are: TV-G for suitable for all ages; TV-PG for parental guidance suggested; TV-14 for parents of children under 14 strongly cautioned; TV-M for mature audiences only and two categories applying to children\'s shows: TV-Y for all children and TV-Y7 for kids seven and older.\nExecutives said they expected programmes such as "Hard Copy" and "Entertainment Tonight" to receive ratings instead of being exempted as bona fide news programmes.\n"Our goal was to create TV parental guidelines which would be simple to use, easy to understand and handy to find, and we have accomplished it," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America and head of the group that developed the television ratings.\nThe group included representatives from the broadcast and cable-TV industries and Hollywood. "We don\'t claim any divine inspiration," Valenti told a news conference, adding that the system was "not written in stone." Industry executives plan to review the ratings over the next few months.\n"What we are presenting is our best offer," Valenti said.\nNetworks and producers will rate their own shows, unlike the movie industry, where an independent panel rates films. TV executives argue they have far more programmes to rate, with up to 2,000 hours a day of shows, equivalent to about 1,000 movies a day.\nCritics, while welcoming the system, say it is vague, does not go far enough and will prove unhelpful to parents. Child advocacy, public health, religious and education groups plan a campaign to see that a content-based system is developed. They favour an approach in which letters such as V, S and L are used to denote the level of violence, sex and bad language.\n"The system which they propose is too complicted. It\'s too vague. It doesn\'t give parents the information which they need in their homes for their kids," said Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts and a vocal critic of the TV industry plan. He called on the industry to test both the aged-based and content-based systems side by side in the home.\nBut industry officials said a content-based plan would be unwieldly. They said their own system would be more practical for parents, and more convenient for newspapers to print.\nThe ratings stem from the telecommunications law enacted in February that requires new TV sets to include a "V-chip." The technology, expected to be available in a year or so, will be used in conjunction with the ratings and allow parents to screen out programmes they do not want their children to watch.\nClinton last week gave the system a conditional green light, saying critics should allow the TV industry to test the ratings for 10 months before demanding changes.\nTop officials at the Federal Communications Commission will review the ratings over the next few weeks. Under the telecommunications law, the FCC must set up an advisory panel to devise a ratings system if the industry fails within a year to craft an "acceptable" plan.\nValenti vowed to fight any government-imposed system in court on First Amendment free speech grounds.\n'

a(S'Negotiations between American Airlines and its pilots union continued into the early hours of Friday, with neither side reporting any breakthrough that would avert a midnight strike at the nation\'s No. 2 carrier.\nA federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier\'s smaller American Eagle planes.\nMediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical "what if" proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation\'s air transport system into turmoil.\n"They\'re going to work all night, throughout the night. All day (Friday)," said Dave Bates, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American\'s 9,000 pilots.\nHe said the union is "disappointed at the lack of progress" so far.\n"We will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes. But (Friday) night at midnight the pilots will be on strike."\nBates said no face-to-face talks had as yet been scheduled. An American spokesman would only say that the negotiations were continuing.\nGoing into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike.\nThe union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes.\nWhile the mediator has informed the union of the airline\'s rejection of the proposal on small planes, union officials said the company itself has not notified them directly of that.\nThe dispute also centres around the pilots\' pay. They now earn an average of about $120,000 a year.\nThe union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a 6 percent boost over four years.\nA strike would ground 2,200 American flights on Saturday and affect about 200,000 passengers. American, a unit of AMR Corp., accounts for about 20 percent of the nation\'s airline capacity.\nThe Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is trying to rebook passengers on other carriers and has already cancelled nearly all international flights scheduled for Friday night.\nAmerican Airlines spokesman John Hotard said on Thursday the carrier was cancelling 12 of its domestic flights scheduled for Friday. "There are some small domestic airports where we have no permanent place to park the planes if there is a strike, so we decided to cancel those 12 flights."\nA Transportation Department official said a strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $200 million a day.\nAmerican Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected.\n"I think mandatory binding arbitration should be required" to prevent airline strikes, Crandall told a congressional subcommittee. Binding arbitration would mean both parties agreed to abide by the decision of an arbitrator.\n"I seriously doubt we could accept that," union spokesman Wally Pitts said.\nCrandall told a hearing of a House of Representatives Transportation subcommittee he was unsure if a strike could be avoided. "We have two choices: we can either cave in or take a strike. A strike of 90 days will destroy this airline."\nAs the talks entered their fourth day of intensive bargaining, President Bill Clinton was keeping a close watch.\nClinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Under the Railway Labour Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and to keep planes flying for 60 days. The last time such an action was taken in an airlines strike was in 1966.\nBut at an unrelated news conference on Thursday, Clinton repeated that the parties should use the government mediator to reach an agreement.\n'

a(S'Sun Microsystems Inc. stock took a beating Wednesday despite reporting a sharp rise in earnings that topped Wall Street\'s average forecasts and set milestones for its typically weak first fiscal quarter.\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker said late Tuesday that its profits jumped 45 percent in its fiscal first quarter to $123.4 million, or 63 cents a share, from $84.7 million, or 42 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. It cited continued strong sales of its computer workstations.\nThe profits were a shade above Wall Street analysts\' average forecast of 61 cents a share as compiled by First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, but investors started taking profits in after-hours trading Tuesday.\nTraders noted the stock had run up ahead of the report, and that while Sun\'s numbers were strong, they were not as strong as had some on Wall Street had been expecting.\nFurthermore, some analysts expressed concerns over whether Sun will be able to match the performance in the future in an increasingly competitive market for workstations as rivals introduce new models of their own.\nThe stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker touched its all-time high of $70.25 Tuesday before the earnings report and ended regular trading at $70. But it fell $4 in after-hours trading following the report.\nThe freefall continued Wednesday, with the shares off as much as $7.625 at one point at a session low of $62.375 and closing the day at $63.125, down $6.875 on Nasdaq trading volume of nearly 18 million shares. It was the most actively traded stock on the exchange.\n"We\'ve got to believe there\'s some profit-taking going on," Sun Chairman Scott McNealy told reporters in a conference call Tuesday when informed of the after-hours decline.\nA number of analysts trimmed their ratings on the 14-year-old computer maker, mostly saying the stock\'s price had already soared to near their 12-month trading targets and that the downgrades were based on valuation rather than fndamentals.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Steve Mulunovich, for example, cut his rating to "outperform" from a "strong buy", with a price target of $75 on the stock. However, he also raised his fiscal 1997 earnings estimate to $3.35 a share from $3.30.\nThe company reported record earnings per share of $2.42 in its 1996 fiscal year, which ended in June.\nAlex. Brown analyst Phil Rueppel also cut his rating, to a "buy" from a "strong buy" and Ferman Selz removed the stock from its recommended list after it hit its $70 price target.\nA few analysts also expressed concern that although Sun has received a great deal of publicity over its Java technology, it also will face stiff competition from rivals Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc., which have just introduced speedy new computer models.\nOther competitors, like personal computer maker Compaq Computer Corp., are also expected to jump into the market with workstations to compete in the high-end market for machines which has long been dominated by a handful of firms.\n"His new competitors are Compaq and Dell Computer. The enemy isn\'t the traditional competitor but a new class of people that can compete in this space," said David Wu, an analyst at Chicago Corp.\nSun scored a small coup Wednesday by hiring Mark Canepa -- a Hewlett-Packard veteran who was just named by Compaq last month to head up its newly formed workstation division -- to instead be vice president of Sun\'s Workgroup Server Products Group.\nStock in Compaq, whose third quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street estimates, also fell, closing down $1.50 ato $73.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading.\nSome analysts said they saw the weakness in Sun\'s stock as a buying opportunity.\nDean Witter analyst Jay Stevens said he raised his earnings estimates for Sun and reiterated a buy rating.\n"They delivered a very fine quarter," Stevens said.\n'

a(S'Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists are turning into political sharks, spending millions of dollars to defeat a California ballot measure that they claim threatens American capitalism and could send stock prices reeling.\nNormally the region, which is the birthplace of such industry stalwarts as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Intel Corp., is more obsessed with Internet software tools and microchips than with politics.\nBut so widespread is the fear that California\'s Proposition 211 could make the state a haven for shareholder lawsuits that once politically neutral executives have been jolted into action -- hanging anti-211 banners on buildings and encouraging employees to vote against the initiative.\nProposition 211 is a far-reaching measure that would eliminate certain safeguards and immunity currently given corporate officers and staff members. For instance, it would hold them liable if they made projections about future results and they turned out to be wrong.\nOpponents of the measure fear that corporate officers would stop making any projections about how their business was doing, making it more difficult to make investment decisions and leading to a decline in share prices.\nProponents argue it will help victims of fraud recover losses. Opponents charge it is an "insidious" bid by securities lawyers to line their own pockets.\nThere were signs the campaign against 211 could affect the outcome. A Los Angeles Times poll published Friday found 52 percent of likely voters now oppose it, up 10 percentage points from a similar Times poll five weeks ago.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has urged California voters to reject the measure, warning it would use the state\'s legal system to roll back the federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed last year.\n"California state courts could become a magnet for class action suits," he wrote in a letter of opposition.\nBoth President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential rival Bob Dole have come out against the measure and a recent study said its passage could result in a loss of up to 1.8 million jobs and a $102 billion drop in U.S. domestic output.\nThe study, by trade economist Clyde Prestowitz, also projected a subsequent rise in "frivolous lawsuits" could result in as much as a 24 percent drop in stock market prices.\nThis, he concluded, "would far outweigh the 4 cents per dollar compensation, or less, that shareholders would receive from settlements and judgments" under the measure.\nHigh-tech companies are considered more vulnerable to shareholder suits because their stocks typically are owned by demanding investors seeking fastest-growing companies, which can make their stock prices more volatile.\nA recent survey by the American Electronics Association of its members found nearly half would consider leaving the state if 211 passes. Some economists estimated it would eliminate 150,000 jobs and cost $1.3 billion in California alone.\nEven companies outside California, like International Business Machines Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. have opposed the measure, concerned that a single California shareholder could bring suit against them.\nIf it passes, high tech leaders like venture capitalist John Doerr, who is leading the $30 million-plus battle against 211, and Cypress Semiconductor Chief Executive T.J. Rodgers, have said they expect outside company directors to quit.\n"If it passes, my net worth, my house, will be on the line," Rodgers said at a recent public debate on the issue here. "It\'s a sleazy trick," he added.\nProponents of 211, including lawyers who bring shareholder lawsuits and stand to benefit directly from it, said they drew up the measure after a business-led initiative in the spring was opposed by nearly 60 percent of California voters.\n"Americans are disgusted by corporate greed," said Richard Alexander, an attorney speaking in favor of the measure recently. "People are angry about massive layoffs."\nBut in Northern California, where high tech businesses have thrived, executives said the proposition was more geared to forcing corporations to settle shareholder suits up front.\n'

a(S'Sun Microsystems Inc. on Tuesday will unveil the long-awaiting stripped-down network computer it claims will cost companies up to 80 percent less to own and operate than a personal computer connected to a network.\nSun\'s Java Computing initiative, including the JavaStation network computer that Sun plans to sell for as little as $750, is the company\'s challenge to the PC market dominance of Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.\nThe formal unveiling at a New York City news conference is the culmination of months of preparation, and the fruition of a strategy that investors consider sufficiently risky to have prompted a sell-off in the company\'s stock earlier this month.\nMicrosoft and Intel announced plans Monday to develop a competing product.\nScott McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun, recently told analysts he believed Sun\'s recent strong financial results were related to its focus on network computing.\nSun Microsystems\' approach to the Network Computer -- in contrast to those of allies Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- is to target major corporate customers for fixed-function applications.\nEarly applications will include such tasks as airline and hotel reservations, kiosks, health care systems and stock trading, and Sun expects to highlight a dozen corporate allies, including British Telecommunications Plc, CSX Corp., Federal Express Corp., and FTD Inc.\nSun also is expected to announce support of top systems integrators, including Andersen Consulting and EDS, and nearly 450 independent software developers.\nThe basic JavaStation itself, which had been code-named "Mr. Coffee," will have the dimensions of an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper, weigh four pounds and have no slots, no hard disk, no CD-ROM and no floppy disk drive.\n"A fully-configured system, with keyboard mouse and good resolution display will be under $1,000 dollars," said Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Co. He said an under-desk machine and a desktop model will be sold.\nSun estimates the machines may cost as little as $2,500 per year to own and administer, or $7,500 over three years, compared with independent estimates of PC costs of up to $11,900, or $35,700 over three years.\nThe JavaStation family will begins shipping in late December to developers and large customers, with volume shipments beginning in 1997.\nSun is also shipping the Netra j server line, with prices ranging from a U.S. list of $7,695 to more than $200,000. Servers are computers that link personal computers in a network.\nSun\'s JavaSoft unit, which is charged with expanding use of the company\'s Java technology, also will demonstrate HotJava Views, a method of viewing electronic mail, World Wide Web pages and scheduling software.\nExecutives declined to say how much HotJava Views will cost, but added it will be priced similar to other software packages on the market, with volume discounts for large sales.\nSeparately in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, the company\'s SunSoft unit is due to provide details of its next-generation Java Workshop system.\nThese include Project Studio, which enables users to create interactive content without writing code, Project Speedway, which speeds up Java applications, and Project ICE-T, which helps connect Java machines to other computer architectures.\n'

a(S'Even before the personal computer era\'s foremost figures donned togas and circus suits for the traditional extravaganzas of the industry\'s annual gala summit, industry titans were jockeying for the limelight.\nAlthough the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor is among the high points of this year\'s show, the next 25 years of the industry are likely to prove even more fast-paced, and bitterly competitive, according to senior executives.\nThe week promises a flurry of new products -- and whole new categories of products ranging from hand-held Windows PCs to new species of the controversial new Network Computer to fast new computer modems and the launch of DVD, digital video disk.\nThe latter technology holds many times the amount of data available on the conventional CD-ROM devices which now come as standard on many desktops, and is likely to appear next year on machines ranging from laptops to home theatre televisions.\nNot only will people be able to play full-length movies on their laptop devices, but the new medium is expected to unleash a whole new genre of computer games using sophisticated three dimensional animation and hot new 3-D computer chips.\nAlthough the annual event is prone to hyperbole -- and it is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million executives, analysts, customers and media people this year -- some high- profile executives believe the time has finally arrived for the long-heralded convergence of television, computers and telecommunications into one vast, interconnected business.\n"I think this convergence is starting to redefine itself as collision," Carl Wankowski, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc., the U.S. operating unit of Sony Corp. told Reuters on the eve of the show.\nSony expects to showcase a variety of products, including DVD technologies and its WebTV set-top box, which turns a television into a simplified Internet browsing device.\nThe opening keynote of the week-long event will be Intel Corp. Chief Executive Andy Grove, who under the theme "A Revolution in Progress," will trace the history of the microprocessor which turned Intel from a fledgling chip company into the world\'s largest semiconductor company.\nGrove will also provide live demonstrations of how personal computers can already be used for sophisticated applications today for complex graphics displays. He will outline goals and challenges facing the PC industry over the next 15 years, with projections for the next quarter century.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates promises to issue a challenge to the industry in a keynote speech whose title harkens back to Gates\' "Information at Your Fingertips" address here six years ago.\nGates, who recently republished his book, "The Road Ahead," in paperback, has said the industry is too optimistic about what it can produce within a short, two-year time frame, but far too pessimistic about what can be achieved in a decade.\nNetscape Communications Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jim Barkesdale on Wednesday will make the third of a trio of keynotes that day, providing insight on how the pioneer of Web browsers sees competition moving to internal corporate networks based on Internet technology, known as intranets.\nBut the celebrations begin already on Sunday night, as International Business Machines Corp.\'s Lotus Development Corp. officially launches its SmartSuite 97 for Windows 95 and Windows NT at a lavish gathering to be followed by IBM\'s famous Toga Party.\nMicrosoft Corp. is due to unveil the Handheld PC (HPC) devices running its Windows CE consumer electronics version of its system at a Treasure Island Hotel bash complete with a Cirque du Soleil performance.\nA handful of major computer companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., are due to unveil mobile Windows CE-based handheld devices.\nOn Monday, Microsoft is due to show off the master version of its lastest productivity suite Office 97, enabling a direct comparison between its offering and Smartsuite 97.\nApple Computer Inc., still seeking to recover from huge losses over the last year, is expected to counter the Windows CE launch with more industry-focused adaptations of its three-year-old Newton handheld technology.\nThe company may also seize the opportunity to provide more details of its future technology plans, as rumours continue to swirl over discussions it has had with startup Be Inc., which has been working on a speedy new operating system.\n'

a(S'Intel Corp President and Chief Executive Andy Grove said on Monday that by the year 2011, microprocessors may be capable of holding one billion transistors and delivering 100,000 million instructions per second (MIPS).\nGrove, delivering the opening keynote address at the personal computer industry\'s Comdex trade show celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first microprocessor, said such advances were possible withing current technological know-how.\nMicroprocessors are the semiconductors, invented by Intel engineers in 1971, that serve as the brains of PCs.  \nGrove said that by 2011, the microprocessors the industry could be producting, given current understanding of the laws of physics, could run at 10 gigahertz, or four times the frequency of a microwave oven.\nThis is roughly 50 times the frequency of the current top-of-the-line microprocessors.\nSpeeds of 100,000 MIPS, a standard measure of computing power, would be 100,000 times the speed of Digital Equipment Corp\'s VAX 1180s, a line of refrigerator-size midrange computers popular in the 1980s.  \nIn a summary text of his speech issued in advance, Grove said the microprocessor of 1996 delivers 400 MIPS, running at a frequency of 200 megahertz (Mhz) with 5.5 million transistors. This, he noted, meets or exceeds a 1989 projection by Intel engineers of 100-MIPS machines at 150 Mhz.\nThe microprocessor of the year 2011 might fit on a die the size of a half dollar, or 1.8 inches, three times the current 0.6-inch die size, the Intel executive added.  \nThe line width resolution of computer microprocessors, which is critical to the ability to add transistors and power, may -- through projected improvements in photolithographic and process technology -- reach 0.07 micron, compared to 0.35 today.\nBut Grove also said the industry must be prepared to meet consumer expectations, including those formed over a half century by the medium of television.\n"We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time," he said in the summary text. "That competition is the TV."\nHe said TVs outnumber PCs worldwide by about three to one.  \n"In this war, he who captures the most eyeballs wins," he said. "In our battle for eyeballs, user experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing, it must exceed them."\nGrove provided demonstrations of the concept of visual computing, one comparing 1992 technology with state-of-the-art technology today, and another showing the high-end Pentium Pro Processor at current performance levels and simulating what will be available in the year 2000.\nIn his address, Grove demonstrated how Starbucks Inc uses connected personal computers to enable its chief executive, Howard Shultz, to communicate directly with the company\'s remote store locations.\n"We need to be relentless in our concern and efforts to grow the number of users and uses of our technology as we are in our efforts to develop and build the technology," he said.\n"Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today."\n'

a(S'U.S. high tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the seasonally-slow third quarter vs. overall U.S. venture investment growth of 25 percent from year-ago levels, according to a survey released by Price Waterhouse Monday.\n"It is so hot it\'s scary," Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.\nVenture investment in high technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.\nSoftware investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.\nFor the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.\n"Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year," Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.\nThe third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.\n"Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second-quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months," said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association.\n"But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries."\nCompanies in the start-up and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.\nOn average start-up companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.\nFunding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet-related companies receiving funding in the quarter exceeding the year-ago period by six times.\nIn a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.\nTypically the two regions account for some 40 percent to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.\n"Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic," because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.\n- sam.perry@reuters.com +1415 846 5400\n'

a(S'WebTV Networks Inc. on Wednesday unveiled a new technology it said enables full-screen, television quality video to be delivered from the Internet through conventional telephone lines.\nSteve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV, said in an interview the new technology will be deployed in upcoming versions of its Internet service, which lets people access the global computer network using their television sets.\nThe privately held company numbers among its equity investors Microsoft Corp., Citicorp, VeriFone Inc., Times Mirror Co. Inc. and Lauder Partners.\nPerlman said the advance, which was being demonstrated publicly for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, speeds download times significantly and greatly increases the quality of video compared with existing systems.\nWebTV said the new technology, which it has dubbed VideoFlash, has impressed officials from companies that might use it to show television and movie previews, news clips and advertising and animation through the WebTV Internet service.\nPublisher National Geographic, known for producing quality videos and photographs, said the technology was the first to provide acceptable quality video over an Internet link.\n"VideoFlash is the first Internet video technology that will allow National Geographic to deliver a visual experience on the Internet comparable to the imagery, drama and depth we offer with our television programming," said Larry Lux, vice president of National Geographic Interactive.\nVideoFlash can achieve three to 10 times the video compression rates of existing compression technologies, such as MPEG, which itself can compress video data by a factor of around 100, Perlman said.\nEven with the fastest modem connections now available, previous technology could take up to half an hour to download a 30-second video clip which could be played on a small window on a computer with generally grainy, shaky quality.\nVideoFlash provides much faster downloading and higher-quality display with little perceptible distortion, according to WebTV.\nPerlman said the software would be licensed at no charge to content providers to make videos available to WebTV subscribers. He said he expected major suppliers of video content over the Internet to adapt VideoFlash this year.\nThe technology is software-based and relies on the WebTV reference design, which takes advantage of WebTV server capabilities as well as its proprietary TV set-top box, and will not be available on other systems, at least initially.\nBut Perlman said he would expect at least one on-line Internet service provider may license the capabilities by the end of 1997.\nWebTV terminal units, introduced in September, are currently manufactured and distributed by Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corp.\n'

The stock was one of the most actively traded on the exchange.\nThe stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has lost more than a quarter of its value since the end of 1996, including a drop of around 19 percent after another analysts\' warning last Wednesday.\nSmith said he remained neutral on the stock but cited industry sources as saying Netscape had scrambled to meet its fourth-quarter numbers at the end of 1996, which he said did not bode well for its current quarter and all of 1997.\n"They closed a significant amount of business on Dec. 31 just to make the quarter, which they\'ve never had to do before," he said. In his research note, Smith wrote, "We have heard of two major deals that were closed on Dec. 31, one of which apparently closed late in the evening."\nBut a spokeswoman for Netscape rebutted this.\nSpeaking after the market closed, she said the company did complete some of its deals toward the end of the quarter, but she denied it was pushing down to the wire to lock up deals that would make a major impact on its financial results.\n"We did no deals that were of materially significance on Dec. 31," she said.\n"Sure, we did deals towards the end of the quarter, like everyone does," the spokeswoman added.\nLast Wednesday, the stock tumbled after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst William Gurley cut his rating on the stock to "accumulate" from "buy" and cited risks from its transition to a new business plan and new pricing.\nSeveral other analysts, including Goldman Sachs\'s Michael Parekh and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.\'s Mary Meeker, have put "buy" or "strong buy" ratings on the stock, recognising near-term risks but remaining upbeat on the stock in the longer term.\n'

a(S'Ambitious plans to establish Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia include the "cleansing" of profits disallowed under Islamic law, a senior fund manager told a mutual funds conference on Tuesday.\nIslamic law prohibits Moslems from earning interest on bank deposits or investing in certain types of equities.\nBut Nik Ezar Nik Bolia, chief executive officer of Malaysia\'s DCB-RHB Unit Trust Management Berhad, said the company had come up with a tried and tested method of working around the rules.\n"The cleansing process takes out the impact of the interest earned," he said. "It\'s against Islam to gain interest on a deposit, so we remove and give to charity a proportion of the total profit."\nDCB-RHB\'s efforts have lured US$80 million into a domestic Islamic fund in Malaysia, where 54 percent of the population is Moslem, he said.\nMore than 85 percent of Indonesia\'s population of nearly 200 million is Moslem, suggesting an equally promising future awaits any fund that appeals to the nation\'s religious principles.\n"Southeast Asia has a combined population of 220 million Moslems," Nik said. "Therefore any product based on Islamic principles will be highly successful."\nTo allay concern about stock market investments, Malaysia\'s Bank of Islam has set up panels of scholars to vet individual stocks to ensure they are "halal", or comply with Sharia law by avoiding liquor, gambling, pornography or footwear, Nik said.\n"Then we look at the core business," he said. "If it is halal that is fine, but if a subisidiary is not halal, the parent company will be rejected. However, if the subsidiary is halal and the parent company not, the subsidiary is halal and will be accepted."\nThe same system will be set up in Indonesia by DCB-RHB\'s subisidiary, P.T. Rashid Hussain Asset Management, Nik said.\nHowever, there are substantial obstacles blocking the path to Moslem mutual fund investment in Indonesia. Among the most obvious is a relatively casual approach to religion.\n"In Malaysia, the law is enforced. If you are not fasting the police can come and catch you, but in Indonesia, religion is encouraged but if you don\'t do it no one really cares," said one delegate to the conference.\nNik countered that 40 percent of Indonesia\'s Moslems are observant, but conceded that a 1,000-person survey disclosed that most were already investing in prohibited bank deposits.\n"Earning interest on bank deposits is a no-no under Sharia law and 61 percent said they knew that, but there is no alternative investment," Nik said.\nHe admitted that persuading these investors to switch into lower-yielding stock market funds subject to profit-cleansing presented a formidable challenge. But he said that savings put towards the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca offered hope.\n"That will be the trick that we have to perform...but every year Indonesia has a high proportion of people going to Mecca," he said.\n"This is my target market. If one of them were to save from ground zero to seven million rupiah into our fund before they redeem to go to Mecca, it is a captive market."\nEach year 195,000 Indonesian Moslems pay 7.55 million rupiah to participate in the government-organised pilgramage to Mecca.\n(US$1 = 2,327 rupiah)\n'

a(S'Hong Kong business groups hit back on Wednesday at U.S. attempts to link China\'s most favoured nation (MFN) trading perks with how Beijing handles Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control later this year.\nU.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe, leading a 22-member delegation from the House of Representatives to Beijing, said on Tuesday the United States will probably want to monitor Hong Kong for at least a year before granting China permanent MFN status.\n"If MFN were conditioned or taken away, especially during the transition period, it would clearly have a devastating effect and make it much more likely that all the things we want for Hong Kong would not be achieved," said Mark Michelson, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.\nChina currently enjoys MFN, subject to annual review.\nHong Kong commentators noted that permanent MFN, which would allow China the same tariff treatment as other big U.S. trading partners without an annual review, was unlikely in 1997, the year that China takes back Hong Kong from Britain.\n"It\'s unfortunate. Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status," said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.\n"But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude."\nLegislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.\nChina, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe\'s congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.\nPolitical analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.\n"Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No," said one analyst, who declined to be identified.\n"But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn\'t hurt."\nAs the leading entrepot for China-U.S. trade, the Hong Kong government has always backed China\'s application for MFN status. But on Wednesday it declined to comment on Kolbe\'s remarks.\nChina\'s annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.\nHowever, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.\nU.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China\'s human rights record in 1995.\n'

a(S'With the World Bank forecasting a 20-percent increase in Asian energy demand each year for the next decade, one could be forgiven for viewing the entire Asian power stock sector as a good bet.\nWrong.\nUncertainty in the form of rapid change looms over one of Asia\'s most important equity sectors, making short-term value hard to find, analysts say.\nJust some of the wild cards include the privatisation of state utilities, a plethora of new, independent power producers (IPPs) and a diverse and government-controlled tariff structure.\n"There is an escalation of the risk/reward ratio of power investments, given the massive changes the industry is undergoing," said BZW Asia Research analyst Thomas Chesser.\n"A number of project-specific, speculative issues are turning once predictable, stable and defensive power investments into high-risk, high-reward plays."\nSTOCK SELECTION CRITICAL\nLonger-term, many Asian power companies are bound to offer strong returns with estimated demand requiring 2,000 megawatts more capacity each month for a decade, implying annual investment of more than US$35 billion.\nBut all analysts agree stock selection will be critical to avoid a variety of short-term hazards.\nIn the past, Asian power stocks tended to track regional markets, but over the next few years up to 40 percent of all new generating assets will be derived from IPPs, creating much greater divergence in share price performance.\nValuations will also come under pressure from a flood of new equity. Within the next two years, the  Electric Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and  National Power Corp in the Philippines are both due for privatization, with another three privatisations in the next four years.\nThe privatisations will join a slew of new equity from the US$5.5 billion Bakun hydroelectric dam project, YTL Corp Bhd and  Port Dickson Power in Malaysia,  Beijing Datang Power Generation Co and Huaneng Power International in China and Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) in South Korea. In total, a flood of about US$2.5 billion in new paper will hit Asian markets this year.\n"While increasing the alternatives available to investors, it is probable that new supply will reduce premiums accorded to already-listed companies," Goldman Sachs analyst Hilary Judis wrote in a recent research report.\nHIGH PREMIUM STOCKS SET TO FALL\nValuations are also expected to rationalise following Southern Electric\'s US$2.7 billion acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd (CEPA) last October.\nThe deal\'s premium of 15-percent to net present value provides a new international benchmark that could speed up an evening-out of domestic stock valuations. Many stocks trading at high premiums can expect to fall sharply.\n"What CEPA has done is call attention to market transactions. A lot of people will view it as a benchmark for value against domestic valuations," Chesser said.\n"It\'s only been three or four months so we haven\'t seen the trickledown come through yet, but some of the dearer IPPs will see the premiums come down. This is not just intuition but based on a survey of fund managers," he added.\nKEPCO GETS BUY RECOMMENDATION\nWhile analysts all commend careful stock-picking as the only safe route through this maze, their recommendations vary widely -- with one notable exception: KEPCO enjoys a buy recommendation from virtually every Asian analyst.\nAs the sole government-owned and operated utility in South Korea, KEPCO enjoys a virtual monopoly on electricity generation and transmission in South Korea, accounting for 95 percent of all electricity generation last year.\nThe stock, with a 12-percent weighting on the Seoul stock market, fell in line with the broad sell-off in South Korean shares in the second half last year before making a breathtaking recovery this month.\nDespite expectations of weak 1996 earnings from higher fuel prices and a punishing foreign exchange rate, KEPCO is now trading at about 27,000 won against a 12-month low of 23,800.\nAnalysts said the stock appears to have priced in expectations of a 28-percent decline in 1996 earnings and now is trading in anticipation of a much better year in 1997, aided by a tariff increase and improved fuel prices.\n"Although any further depreciation in the won will likely not be helpful to KEPCO we expect the decline in oil prices to more than compensate," said Caroline Rogers at Merrill Lynch.\nCHINA\'S HNP FAVOURED, EXPANDING\nChina\'s Huaneng Power International (HNP) is also favoured by most analysts, but it does not enjoy KEPCO\'s universal popularity.\nMerrill Lynch said HNP, with the highest valuation among the four Chinese power companies, is known for its strong relationships -- always important in Asia -- and a quality management led by Li Xiaopeng, the son of China\'s premier Li Peng. Li senior runs the State Council, overseeing capital expenditure and tariff increases.\nHNP is expanding its existing four power plants to 6,200 megawatts over the next five years from 1,900 megawatts now, boosting annual earnings growth by a projected 24 percent.\nMost analysts also like Hong Kong and China Gas for its stable earnings growth, China exposure and property investments. But Hong Kong Electric and China Light and Power received a mixed response thanks an uncertain regulatory environment, unstable earnings outlook and problems with overcapacity.\nManila Electric Co in the Philippines is also popular as a monopoly with good exposure to an accelerating economy. But some analysts warn the stock\'s valuation, formerly justified by strong profit growth and positioning, will have to change to reflect no more tariff increases until the year 2000.\nAnd while some expect Meralco to benefit from the privatisation of National Power Corporation, which is run by many ex-Meralco personnel, others see increased investor choice eroding Meralco\'s share premium.\nAnalysts are neutral to negative on Malaysia\'s Tenaga Nasional Bihad, which faces a loss of its monopoly on transmission and distribution, uncertainty surrounding any tariff increases, and the possibility that the government will demand that the company provide a rebate to customers damaged by a recent blackout.\n'

a(S'Asia will suffer only minor damage from an anticipated shake-out in Thailand\'s banking sector, analysts said on Wednesday.\n"That\'s not a very healthy market and it\'s not a reflection on any of the others," said Carmen Welso, banking analyst with ING Barings in Hong Kong.\nBut some countries could take some precautionary steps to prevent the same thing happening within their borders, another analyst said.\nThe Thai government\'s public acknowledgement that its banks and finance companies are grappling with a huge liquidity problem caused by bad debts, many linked to a besieged property sector, prompted tough new provisioning rules on Monday.\nThe country\'s central bank, the Bank of Thailand, ordered banks and finance companies to raise provisions for sub-standard loans and asked 10 cash-strapped finance firms to boost capital.\nMany analysts said on Wednesday they now expected to see a wave of consolidation sweep through Thailand\'s financial services sector.\nFor example, Thailand needed about five finance companies rather than the 90 that currently exist, one analyst said.\n"People are going to look at Thailand and say \'we don\'t want that happening here\'," said a banking analyst.\nIndonesia and the Philippines could follow Malaysia\'s lead and restrict property lending rules to avoid Thailand\'s experience, he said.\n"They\'ll try to control property bubbles, which is what Malaysia did a few years ago," he added.\nMost analysts said it was too early to identify obvious candidates in Thailand for merger or takeover apart from the list of 10 finance firms ordered to raise capital immediately.\nBut foreign banks with stakes in some of the companies already affected by the shake-out would feel some immediate pain, she said.\nOne example was Development Bank of Singapore, which owns part of Thai Danu Bank.\nThai Danu announced a merger with Finance One Plc over the weekend. Finance One is Thailand\'s largest finance company.\nAnother analyst said that although it was too soon to identify obvious targets, some of Asia\'s biggest banks would soon start cherry-picking their way through the debris in Thailand, looking for possible takeover targets.\nCitibank, HSBC Holdings Plc and ING Barings were considered likely buyers, although foreign restrictions could be a disincentive. Foreigners are restricted to holding only 25 percent of banks or finance companies, effectively preventing them from gaining control.\n"I think they\'ll be under pressure to admit foreign banks to take control of bigger slices of Thai banks and especially Thai finance candidates," the analyst said.\nBut Thailand was in a relatively good position to confront these problems, with the economy forecast to grow about 6.5 percent this year, he said.\n"Unlike Japan, they don\'t have economic contraction," he said. "My guess is if they shift their seat they can get out of it fairly quickly. They\'re not going to persist for four or five years like the banking problem in Japan."\n-- Hong Kong bureau (852) 2843 6470\n'

a(S'Foreign investors seeking access to China could consider the road industry, which needs more than US$6 billion in foreign money to complete four national highways by 2000, SBC Warburg said.\nLow rates of investment are considered largely responsible for clogged highways in China, where 1,500 counties and 190,000 villages had no road access at the end of 1994.\nRoad building has not kept pace with the growth in civilian vehicles, which has risen a compound 13.4 percent each year between 1978 and 1995 -- roughly in line with the country\'s rapid economic expansion.\nBy comparison, the total length of highways over the same period has increased only by an average 1.6 percent a year.\n"The main reason behind this slow development in China\'s highway network is the insufficient investment in the sector," SBC Warburg said recently.\nInvestment is a pressing problem with China\'s ambitious plan to build a network of 12 national trunk routes totalling 30,000 km by the 2010, with the first four highways to be completed by 2000.\nTotal construction cost is estimated at 540 billion yuan ($65 billion) over 10 years, most of which will come from domestic funding, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\n"However, it is estimated that as much as $6 billion will have to come from foreign investors," SBC Warburg said.\nForeign investors first started entering China\'s road industry during the Eighth Five Year Plan, and the resulting investment helped to accelerate the expansion of highways 12.6 percent to 1.15 million km between 1991 and 1995.\nAmong the better-known foreign-invested higways are Hopewell Holding\'s Guangzhou-Shenzhen Superhighway; New World Infrastructure\'s Guangzhou Northern Ring Road, which opened in 1994; Road King Infrastructure, which signed its first toll road joint venture in December 1993; Cheung Kong Infrastructure and CITIC Pacific.\nGuangdong Investment and Guangzhou Investment are also active players.\nMost projects are toll roads, which SBC Warburg warned can be difficult to set up and operate in China. Central and provincial approvals are required and collection can be fraught with "natural" hazards such as traffic accidents and robberies.\n"It does not seem to us, however, that such irregularities are damaging the investment merits of Chinese toll roads, if the investor can work closely with the local authorities on containing the leakage at some pre-determined levels," the broker said.\nThere are clear signs that China is actively encouraging foreign investment in this sector.\nExpressways, tunnels and bridges are open to 100 percent foreign ownership and there is no limit in foreign participation in Chinese joint ventures on first and second-class highways.\nExperiments with various types of funding sources and investment structures are being encouraged.\nAnd, as part of the central government\'s efforts to promote a more standardised build-operate-transfer structure for infrastructure projects, it is preparing to offer a bridge in Wuhan for international tender.\n"We expect the market to be increasingly open to foreign participation, as additional funding sources help attract more investors and reduce financing costs," SBC Warburg concluded.\n-- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6470\n'

a(S'Hong Kong\'s hefty cash reserves offer a comfortable cushion for children born in 1997, the year the British colony returns to Chinese sovereignty.\nAccording to Wednesday\'s 1997/98 budget figures, thrifty Hong Kong will confront its future as part of China with HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in total fiscal reserves.\nThat works out to more than US$6,500 for each man, woman and child in the territory.\nBy comparison, gross national debt in the United States of US$5.5 trillion translates into a debt of US$20,500 for every child born there this year.\nBut Financial Secretary Donald Tsang resisted the temptation to hand down a give-away budget.\nInstead of widely-anticipated tax cuts, Tsang\'s budget speech for 1997/98 (April-March) stressed the need for continuity in 1997, and Hong Kong\'s ability to work with China to strike a balance.\n"Fortunately, our healthy public finances and robust economic prospects have made the task of finding the right balance somewhat easier," Tsang said.\nBut critics were not satisfied by the government\'s failure to spend more on the needy, particularly the elderly, while reporting a budget surplus of HK$15.1 billion this year rising to HK$31.7 billion in 1997/98. "I think the size of the surplus is utterly obscene and I\'m very, very mad just on that," said Emily Lau, an independent Democrat and outspoken critic of the government\'s social policy.\n"We are probably the richest place on earth and to think we have several hundred thousand poeple living from hand to mouth.\n"I\'ve got nothing against the tax reduction on wine, that\'s fine. But I think we should also do something for the elderly."\nTsang cut duties on wine to 60 percent from 90 percent.\nExperts warned that the gap between rich and poor in Hong Kong is bound to widen as impoverished Chinese immigrants flock to Hong Kong seeking streets paved with gold.\nIn 1995, Hong Kong increased the quota for mainland immigrants to 150 a day from 105, mainly for family reunions.\n"Twenty years ago, Hong Kong could absorb impoverished migrants from the mainland in large numbers because it had an immense need for cheap labour," said David Dodwell, a director at Jardine Fleming Holdings.\n"Today, that is no longer the case. Now our capacity to absorb those in the economy today is much less than it used to be. We don\'t have the unskilled jobs," he said.\nHong Kong\'s rapid transformation from international manufacturing and industrial hub into a services economy geared to China\'s economic expansion has caused the relocation of virtually its entire manufacturing base into southern China.\nTsang\'s highly conservative budget indicated growing awareness of the potential ramifications of mainland immigration, with a 150-percent boost to spending on benefits for newly-arrived mainland children.\n"As for the children, we help them fit into our schools with special support services and remedial English programmes," he said. "In 1997/98 we will spend a total of around HK$168 million on these children -- an increase of over 150 percent in real terms of 1996/97."\n($ = 7.74 HK dollars)\n'

a(S'Visiting Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia said on Monday she hoped to boost cooperation with Beijing to help both nations crack down on a flourishing narcotics trade.\nColombian officials said they hoped to sign an agreement with China that would increase information exchanges and strengthen police training in the fight against drugs.\n"The Chinese were very clear that they very much wanted to seek cooperation in the matter of drugs," said Mejia, who is accompanying Colombian President Ernesto Samper on a three-day visit to China.\n"We want to exchange knowledge in the field of fighting heroin trafficking," Mejia told reporters, adding that the rise of the heroin trade in Colombia -- infamous for its cocaine cartels -- was a relatively new development.\n"Colombia knows very little about narcotics trafficking in Asia, and we have to know more, and China has to know more about narco-trafficking in South America, otherwise it will be very difficult to have a multilateral policy," Mejia said.\nShe did not say when she expected the proposed accord to be signed.\nSamper told a news briefing Beijing had expressed support for Colombia\'s anti-drug efforts, but did not elaborate.\nBeijing had expressed an interest in pursuing a policy not only of cracking down on drug traffickers but of preventing and treating drug addiction, Mejia said.\nChina\'s official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as urging major drug-consuming nations to bolster their efforts to reduce domestic drug use.\n"Drug-consuming countries should also shoulder heavy responsibility because the great market demand for drugs would result in widespread drug production and trafficking," Qian was quoted as saying.\nColombia\'s top anti-drug policeman General Rosso Jose Serrano told the briefing he did not think Colombian and Chinese drug cartels were working together to distribute heroin throughout North America.\n"The Chinese mafia is the most difficult to penetrate, but as far as we know, there is no connection between Colombian and Chinese (drug traffickers)," said Serrano, who is widely credited with smashing Colombia\'s notorious Cali cocaine cartel.\nA report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration last month said Colombia had edged out southeast Asia\'s Golden Triangle region as the top supplier of high-grade heroin to the United States.\nThe report said 62 percent of all heroin confiscated in the United States came from Colombia.\nChina faces a growing problem with drug trafficking, much of it through the southwestern province of Yunnan which borders on the Golden Triangle drug production region that includes parts of Burma, Thailand and Laos.\nChina frequently executes people convicted of narcotics crimes and sentences many drug users to strict rehabilitation programmes.\n'

a(S'U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis has begun talks with Chinese officials in Beijing on arms proliferation issues, a U.S. Embassy official said on Monday.\n"She has arrived and started talks," the official said by telephone. Davis arrived in Beijing last Thursday and was due to hold talks on Monday and Tuesday.\n"She is the undersecretary for arms control issues... She has a whole range of issues that she\'ll be bringing up with the Chinese," the official said when asked what Davis would discuss with her hosts.\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn flew into Beijing last week for talks before Davis\'s visit.\nJohn Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, also visited the Chinese capital recently.\nOfficials have said Davis would discuss how the two countries might implement a decade-old, peaceful nuclear cooperation accord that would let U.S. firms sell nuclear power reactors to China.\nBeijing has tried to lure foreign technology, some of it with potential military value, with promises of lucrative business contracts.\nChina\'s official Xinhua news agency said on Monday that U.S. firms stood to win billions of dollars of nuclear energy contracts if the 1985 agreement were put into effect.\n"Sino-U.S. cooperation in nuclear energy development has yet to enter a substantial stage," Xinhua quoted Li Donghui as saying.\n"Negotiations on the agreement are still under way," added Li, the deputy-general director of the China National Nuclear Corp\'s international cooperation bureau.\nThe pact has not been implemented because of Washington\'s concern that Beijing has sold nuclear technology to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in other nations, most notably to Pakistan.\nBoth China and Pakistan deny the charges.\nChina agreed last May not to provide aid such as ring magnets and other devices used in making nuclear weapons to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.\nU.S. officials say a reported nuclear-related deal between Beijing and Islamabad was struck before the May accord was drawn up and that they have no evidence China has violated the pact.\nDavis would also renew U.S. concerns over Chinese sales of conventional arms to Iran, who Washington has blacklisted as a sponsor of terrorism, officials have said.\nWashington is investigating reports that Indonesia and China are close to a deal to sell Iran five French helicopters that could be armed with air-launched missiles.\nDavis\'s talks were expected to pave the way for a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher later this month, his first to China in two years.\nChristopher\'s 1994 visit ended in bitter wrangling over human rights issues.\nSino-U.S. relations have been battered in recent months by disputes over human rights, China\'s rampant copyright abuse and Beijing\'s terms of entry into the World Trade Organisation.\nThe White House said last week it was deeply concerned over a Chinese court verdict sentencing prominent pro-democracy activist Wang Dan to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.\n'

a(S'China\'s defence sector and state-owned heavy industries are the country\'s biggest loss-makers but reform of the lumbering state sector is proceeding at a snail\'s pace, analysts said on Friday.\nMore than 45 percent of China\'s 68,800 state industrial firms posted losses from January to September, a rise of 17.6 percent from the same period last year, according to the latest data from the State Statistical Bureau.\n"Those most in need of help would be the military industries and traditional industries," said Zheng Haihang, a professor of industrial economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nTraditional industries included the coal and oil sectors as well as heavy industry, Zheng said by telephone.\n"To put it simply, it\'s mostly these traditional industries, which have a very backward structure," Zheng said of the state sector\'s mounting losses.\nMany of China\'s state-run enterprises are overstaffed and unable to compete in domestic or overseas markets. They also carry the heavy burden of providing cradle-to-grave welfare services for their employees.\nThe combined losses of state firms reached 65.12 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) during the first nine months of the year, a rise of 45.7 percent from a year ago, official figures show.\nCompounding the problem is interest on unpaid debts -- a substantial burden even after two interest rate cuts this year.\n"The debt burden of state-owned enterprises is very heavy, so of course this affects their profitability," Zheng said.\nThe January-September net profits of China\'s state industries fell to 11.28 billion yuan, down 75.8 percent from the same period last year, the statistics show.\nReform of defence industries -- many based in remote and backward inland regions and fitted with ageing technology -- had proceeded slowly, the economist said.\n"Military industries are trying to transform into civilian industries, but the transition is extremely difficult -- there\'s no capital," he said.\nOfficials have said more than 200 state firms have been declared insolvent to date but Beijing has been wary of pushing ahead with bankruptcies.\nBeijing fears that reform of state enterprises will lead to mass unemployment and eventually spark social unrest, said one Western analyst reached by telephone.\n"That\'s one major reason why reform is going so slowly," said the analyst, who declined to be identified.\nChina\'s trade unions had set up a special fund this year to help workers in ailing state firms, the China Daily newspaper said on Friday.\n"The relief fund...is designed to help employees from money-losing state-owned enterprises maintain decent living standards," the newspaper said.\nUnions had raised 1.2 billion yuan so far this year to help about seven million impoverished workers in state enterprises and disaster-stricken areas, it said.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n'

a(S'Shares in British insurer Commercial Union (CU) jumped on Friday amid renewed speculation the insurance group may become the next victim in the industry\'s push to consolidate.\nRumours that a merger were in the offing were given a new lease of life after buying of CU shares late on Thursday. The shares rose on Friday, jumping in late trading to close 19-1/2p at 663-1/2p, ignoring worries about interest rates which sent stock prices across the rest of the London market tumbling.\nTobacco and financial sevices giant BAT Industries has been at the centre of the most recent rumours with reports last weekend that discussions between the two had foundered.\nBoth companies have maintained their silence on whether discussions have actually taken place but earlier this week BAT said it was keeping an open mind about the opportunities for finding a partner for its financial services arm.\nThe search for cost savings and economies of scale are behind the latest drive to consolidate in Britain\'s increasingly competitive and fragmented insurance industry.\nNew entrants selling insurance over the telephone such as Direct Line have added to competition while the selling of insurance products through banks, building societies and shops is also expected to gather momentum.\nRoyal Insurance and Sun Alliance combined operations back in July to create Britain\'s biggest insurer and estimates it will be able to cut costs by 175 million pounds ($289.6 million) annually by 1998, shedding some 5,000 employees in the process.\nLike the retail banking industry, insurance companies tend not to be dependent on key individuals and mergers are not fundamentally difficult to achieve, said analysts.\nOne estimated that cost savings in a tie-up between Commercial Union and BAT Industries could probably add another 20 percent to combined operating profits.\nWhile analysts conceded that reports the company has been discussing a deal with others in the industry may be true, they were quick to point out that such discussions have been commonplace in recent years.\n"Anyone who wanted to talk to CU would at least be listened to -- they\'ve got shareholders to consider. But these things are not new. These companies have been talking to each other for as long as I can remember on a regular basis," said one analyst.\n"But I think CU feels quite capable of controlling its own destiny and I\'m not convinced that they would think another insurance company had much to offer."\nThe question of which management would come out on top in any merger is another tricky issue and was said to have been behind the breakdown in talks with BAT.\nInterest from abroad has also been rumoured with German insurance group Allianz said to have been contemplating a move for CU. General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange have also been linked with CU.\nA full-scale takeover is a more remote possibility with the necessary premium on the current share price likely to offset many of the cost savings.\nBut even a merger would bring with it a multitude of problems and would put questionmarks over relationships built up with banks and financial institutions in its continental European businesses.\n"There\'s pressure on both the non-life and life industries to get together and cut costs and CU is as much a part of that as anybody else. I\'m sure that most companies have talked or thought about talking to other companies. Whether anything comes of it or not is a completely different matter," said an analyst.\nTakeover talk also extended to the insurance broking market late Friday as rumours circulated of a predator stalking Sedgwick Group Plc whose shares closed 5p higher at 125-1/2p.\n($1=.6043 Pound)\n'

a(S'British life assurer Scottish Amicable said on Thursday it planned to shed its 170-year-old mutual status in favour of a stock market flotation aimed at taking advantage of opportunities for profit growth.\nThe Stirling-based group outlined plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in three to five years\' time and said it would pay policy-holders an initial special bonus of 75 million pounds ($125 million) after demutualising on May 1.\nScottish Amicable said pay-outs would be based on the length of time policies had been held by members.\nThe fist payment would be followed by benefits worth more than 200 million pounds as a result of flotation, which will give the group access to long-term capital, it added.\nThe group said it expected to have a market capitalisation of around 1.0 billion pounds on flotation.\nScottish Amicable said significant opportunities existed for profitable growth in its businesses. But it said in a statement that to take full advantage "requires access to external capital in both the short and long term."\nThere has been intense speculation that Scottish Amicable, founded in 1826, would be the subject of a takeover bid but chairman Sandy Stewart said the group intended to hold on to its independence.\n"Our plans do not include being gobbled up by anybody," he told a news briefing.\nThe group said the process would be in two stages. Under the plan, the business, staff and operations of the group would be transferred to a new company, Scottish Amicable Life, a 100 percent subsidiary of newly formed Scottish Amicable Holdings.\nThe first stage involves a deal with reinsurance giant Swiss Re and its affiliate Securitas Capital "to provide substantial financial backing initially totalling 395 million pounds".\nUnder this agreement Scottish Amicable\'s existing with-profit fund will receive an immediate cash contribution of 350 million pounds "from the reinsurance by Swiss Re of certain categories of existing policy".\nSecuritas Capital has committed to invest up to 45 million pounds in return for approximately 20 percent of a new business fund being set up to transact all new business from the date on which the scheme becomes effective.\nSwiss Re has also agreed to provide further reinsurance "expected to reach a level of 150 million pounds over the next five years in respect of future new business".\nScottish Amicable said Roy Nicolson, currently managing director of the group, would become group chief executive of Scottish Amicable Holdings, while Paul Bradshaw, deputy managing director, will become chief executive of Scottish Amicable Life.\nPolicyholders must first approve the plans at a special general meeting expected to be held in March. The group said detailed discussions had already been held with Britain\'s Department of Trade and Industry. ($1=.5958 Pound)\n'

a(S'Prudential Corp Plc, Britain\'s largest life insurance group, reported a healthy rise in profits on Wednesday and said it expected British operations to continue to perform strongly in the coming year.\nBut the company remained tight-lipped about negotiations with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) over the ownership of so-called orphan assets.\nPrudential (Pru) finance director Jonathan Bloomer said discussions with the DTI were continuing, but said it was difficult to say how long they might last.\n"We always thought they would take a long time and there\'s nothing sensible that can be added to that. I think discussions will continue for a while yet this year."\nAnalysts believe the Pru is looking to free up around three billion pounds ($4.9 billion) of the orphan assets -- money built up in with-profits funds surplus to policyholders\' needs.\nPru operating profits for the year rose over eight percent to 873 million pounds, with profits from continuing operations of 691 million pounds. Reflecting the 1996 performance and the group\'s confidence for the future, the dividend was raised by 10 percent to 17.3 pence per share.\nPru shares gave a muted response to the figures, adding seven pence to 570 pence by mid-morning.\nPru\'s chief executive Sir Peter Davis called it a very successful year and said the results demonstrated the strength of the group\'s core business.\nWith the disposal of Mercantile &amp; General (M&amp;G) and the launch of Prudential Banking, considerable progress had been made in focusing the group on markets where the Pru had the expertise and the critical mass to generate real value for shareholders, he said.\nThe sale of M&amp;G for 1.75 billion pounds in December realised a profit of 766 million pounds.\nPrudential Banking, launched on October 1, is already processing applications for 103 million pounds of mortgages and has taken 98 million pounds in deposits.\nThe company plans to expand the product range and move in to the personal loan market later this year.\nBloomer repeated the Pru\'s interest in establishing the high street distribution network which a building society acquisition would provide. With net cash at year-end standing at 1.1 billion pounds, the group has the financial strength to contemplate such a move.\nBut Bloomer said it was unlikely to make a move unless it enhanced shareholder value which, given current price levels in the sector, may be difficult to pull off.\nThe Pru is currently involved in a takeover battle for Scottish Amicable and made an initial 1.9 billion pound offer for the mutually-owned life insurer earlier this month, only 250 million pounds of which will come from shareholders\' funds.\nPrudential UK operating profits from insurance business increased eight percent to 398 million pounds and operating profits for the British savings and investment business was 323 million pounds, an increase of six percent.\nAfter cutting Prudential UK\'s cost base by 170 million pounds over the past four years, it was approaching a point of diminishing returns, though the group was looking to reduce unit costs further, Bloomer said.\nU.S. operations Jackson National Life saw operating profits growing 35 percent to $512 million.\nWhile confident about the outlook for the business, Bloomer said growth was unlikely to continue at the 40 percent rate seen in recent years.

a(S'The battle for control of Scottish Amicable became a three-way race on Friday as the deadline for firm offers for the mutually-owned life insurer passed.\nThe company said that it had received three initial bids from high street bank Abbey National Plc and insurance groups Prudential Corp Plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP).\nDetails of the bids were not released.\nWhile technically the door is still open for other bidders to come in, a source close to the deal said that was "unrealistic" at this stage.\nUnder the terms of the auction process, ScotAm agreed it would make firm offers public if required by a bidder. It said none had asked it to do so.\nWith the auction effectively a sealed-bid process and bidders unable to see competing offers, there would appear to be little advantage in one company giving rivals a target by making public its own proposals.\nAMP development director Jonathan Schwarz said the group believed it would be wrong to handicap discussions with ScotAm by conducting them in the "glare of publicity".\nBoth the Pru and Abbey said they had nothing to add to earlier statements.\nDiscussions with the three companies will be held with a view to obtaining final offers by mid-March.\nScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart said the three proposals represented an "excellent outcome to this phase of the process".\n"We can now move on to the next phase with every expectation of delivering maximum value to policyholders."\nThe company said it would not be expressing an opinion on the merits or otherwise of any proposal until the evaluation process was complete. Last week ScotAm asked for firm offers for the company by today. It hopes to recommend a single proposal to policyholders by the end of March.\nNational Westminster Bank was among a "about half a dozen" companies which signed confidentiality agreements to gain access to ScotAm\'s books but pulled out earlier this week. Lloyds TSB has also admitted it ran the slide rule over ScotAm but said it felt the bid premium looked too high. Schwarz said ScotAm was one of a number of current opportunities which fulfilled the group\'s criteria. He said the group was looking to acquire British and U.S. businesses with quality local management, marketing and distribution in place which, with the backing of AMP\'s financial strength, could deliver "substantial organic growth". The auction was sparked by Abbey National\'s bid for the company at the end of January. That came barely two weeks after ScotAm had released its own proposals to drop mutual status and float on the London stock market. Abbey\'s offer was topped a week later by the Pru\'s 1.9 billion pound ($3.1 billion) bid, though that figure includes a 1.1 billion pound loan element. Both companies have said that their offers may be raised when they had more detailed financial information on ScotAm.\n($ = 0.614 British Pounds)\n'

a(S'Stiff competition and severe weather in the U.S. led to a 15 million pound ($24.2 million) fall in 1996 profits from British insurer General Accident Plc on Tuesday, despite a record final quarter.\nThe weather-related losses knocked 30 million pounds off operating profits which slipped to 421 million pounds over the year.\nEchoing recent remarks from rival insurers, chief executive Bob Scott described the market as "increasingly competitive", although he was hopeful of a rise in motor premiums in the coming year.\nGeneral Accident intends to raise all motor rates, covering about 800,000 vehicles, by around 3.2 percent in April.\nThat increase will be reviewed in July and Scott said an eight percent rise for the year as a whole was the sort of increase needed given current market conditions.\nThe big question is whether such rises stick. Last year\'s four percent April increase resulted in an eventual rise of between two and three percent.\nThere were, however, no signs of rate increases in the homeowner or commercial sectors, said Scott.\nDespite the fall in 1996 profits and even allowing for a 10 million pound boost from a change in the way the group accounts for overseas earnings, the results were at the top end of market expectations.\nYear-end net assets per share, up a slightly less-than-expected three percent at 675 pence by year-end, have since risen to 734 pence.\nA 10-1/2 percent increase in the dividend for the year to 34.25 pence per share was also ahead of forecast and by late afternoon the shares had added 11 pence to 848 pence.\nAnalysts welcomed a resilient underwriting performance, especially in the fourth quarter in Britain and the United States, and the level of profitability in new business in the group\'s life operations.\n"There\'s some justification in adding some goodwill over the net asset value (NAV) into the share price for future profitable new business in life," commented one analyst.\nThe acquisition of Provident Mutual in January 1996 helped fuel a 37 percent increase in life and pension profits over the year to 108 million pounds.\nProvident contributed 18 million pounds after reorganisation costs of 16 million pounds and Scott said the group was now looking to capitalise on the pension expertise which Provident had brought.\nThe key for the life company was the profitability of new business, said Scott, but he ruled out any major acquisitions in the drive to expand the business.\n"At the present time there\'s nothing wrong with organic growth in life. We\'ve proved we\'re capable of achieving that."\nThe group has set itself the goal of increasing the proportion of more stable life earnings to a level which covers dividends each year. In 1996 the proportion of dividend covered by net life earnings in 1996 was 44 percent.\nScott also dismissed speculation of a merger or takeover involving General Accident.\n"We\'ve got the benefits of scale in our major businesses. We don\'t have to do anything. We\'d like to make further acquisitions in the U.S. Midwest but don\'t see any need to dramatically change our current shape," said Scott.\nInvestment income over the year was up seven percent but the rise in stock markets to record levels over 1996 has prompted the company to reduce exposure to British and North American equities over the past three quarters and shift money into bonds.

a(S"Scottish Amicable on Monday confirmed that three companies had submitted final offers for the mutually-owned insurance group by last Friday's bid deadline.\nHigh street bank Abbey National plc and insurers Prudential Corp plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) must now wait until the end of the month to find out who has won the fight for control of the hotly-pursued ScotAm.\nNone of the bidders have taken up the option of making their offers public, allowing the company's board and its advisers SBC Warburg to weigh up the competing bids behind closed doors.\nIn an effort to deflect criticism of the sealed-bid process ScotAm had agreed to publish details of offers, if asked to do so by a bidder.\nBut for the moment all three seem content to abide by Scotam's preference for confidentiality. They have also committed themselves to accepting its decision at the end of March as final.\nThe board's endoresement will go a long way in ultimately securing ownership of the group but does not guarantee it.\nTwo-thirds of the 1.1 million policyholders who own the company must approve the choice and after widespread criticism of management's handling of both its own plans to float ScotAm and the auction process, its recommendation is likely to come under close scrutiny.\nScotAm, based in Stirling in central Scotland, has arranged for an independent tribunal to resolve any dispute arising from the takeover battle and has repeatedly stressed that the interests of its policyholders will be uppermost in its decision.\nThose interests are likely to be focused upon bidders' long-term investment plans rather than upfront payouts and one of Warburg's main difficulties will be comparing very differently structured proposals.\nIndependent actuaries and the Department of Trade &amp; Industry are to be consulted before the final decision is made.\nJob security for ScotAm's 2,200 employees is also likely to play a major part and all three bidders have been quick to calm fears of job cuts.\nAMP has said it would consider moving its Bristol-based London Life business to Scotland if it won while both Abbey and the Pru have said job preservation in Stirling would be a priority.\nAMP, Abbey and the Pru are all that are left of half a dozen companies, including National Westminster Bank and Lloyds TSB who last month signed confidentiality agreements with ScotAm to evaluate the company as a takeover prospect.\nThe price tag -- widely expected to top two billion pounds ($3.2 billion) -- has been cited by many companies as the reason for withdrawing from the race with acquisition goodwill likely to top one billion pounds.\nAMP has made no effort to disguise its desire to expand in both the British and U.S. market and has said it would shift its attention to another target if it were to miss out on ScotAm.\nBoth the Pru and Abbey have already said that their original proposals might be increased once they had access to more detailed financial detail on ScotAm.\nAbbey's original bid was worth up to 1.4 billion pounds while the Pru's 1.9 billion pound offer included a loan element to bolster ScotAm's life fund.\nThose bids came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float itself on the stock market.\n($ = 0.624 British Pounds)\n"

It represents the death of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong."\nMembers of the Democratic Party had planned to pass a letter to Qian but were unable to get past police lines. An official eventually came out to accept the letter.\n"We hope you will exchange views with Hong Kong people on the setting up of the provisional legislature and selection of the Chief Executive," the letter said.\nThe Selection Committee was holding a first round of voting on Friday to narrow down the list of candidates to step into the shoes of colonial governor Chris Patten when British rule ends at midnight on June 30 next year.\nTo qualify, candidates for the job of Chief Executive must be nominated by at least 50 members of the committee.\nTwo business magnates and two former judges are regarded as the front-runners in the race. The Selection Committee meets again on December 11 to pick the winner.\n'

a(S'China\'s Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was greeted by angry protesters on Friday when he arrived to open a historic meeting to choose Hong Kong\'s future leaders.\nPolice scuffled with demonstrators when they blocked access to the Convention Centre, where Britain will formally return its colony to China in 228 days\' time.\nQian will preside over the 400-member Selection Committee, which began its month-long mission to select the Chief Executive and 60 members of a replacement legislature.\nA group of about 30 police surrounded a handful of student activists and herded them towards barricades where other protesters were sequestered. Many had spent the night on a protest fast outside the building.\nHong Kong\'s pro-democracy lobby has attacked the process and refused to take part in the selection committee which they have branded as undemocratic.\nThey are adamantly opposed to China\'s plan to dissolve the elected legislature and replace it with an interim provisional chamber until new elections are staged.\nOne student was pushed to the ground before being hauled over the barricades into the cordoned-off area by other protesters. "I am very frightened," the university student said. "I don\'t know why they pushed me."\nWaving banners and using loud hailers, about 40 demonstrators chanted "We want a directly elected legislature" and "We reject the deterioration of democracy".\nPolice flung themselves against the barricades to hold back surging demonstrators, some of whom held up a large black box.\n"This is a coffin. It represents the death of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong," one demonstrator said.\nMembers of the Democratic Party had planned to pass a letter to Qian but were unable to get past police lines.\n"We hope you would exchange views with Hong Kong people on the setting up of the Provisional legislature and selection of the Chief Executive," the letter to Qian said.\nThe Selection Committee is due to hold a first round of voting on Friday to narrow down the list of candidates to step into the shoes of colonial governor Chris Patten when British rule draws to a close at midnight on June 30 next year.\nTo enter the final run-off for the job, a candidate must be nominated by at least 50 members of the committee.\nTwo business magnates and two former judges are regarded as the frontrunners in the race.\nThe Selection Committee meets again on December 11 to pick the winner.\n'

a(S'Commercial sponsors have flocked to the Portuguese enclave of  Macau to back Sunday\'s annual Grand Prix despite fears that China wants to steal the show.\nFans of Asia\'s answer to Monte Carlo fear a Formula One track, recently constructed just across the border in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, will seduce sponsors and signal the death knell for Macau\'s Formula Three race.\nMacau has no special track with the race run through the enclave\'s twisting streets.\nBut the concerns have not materialised this year at least and Macau is festooned with banners, kiosks and giveaways from sponsors including French oil concern Elf, Budweiser and Corona beer, watchmaker Omega and Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama.\n"Zhuhai hasn\'t really affected Macau because most of its sponsors are here for very specific reasons," said Stephanie de Kantzow, an organiser of the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix.\nThe annual event, about 60 kilometres west-southwest of Hong Kong, started in 1954 and many of the world\'s top drivers have cut their teeth on the tricky 6.2 km (3.8 miles) Guia street circuit. Double Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher, and current Formula One champion Damon Hill are past Macau competitors.\nChina also insists it is not seeking to edge Macau out of hosting international motor racing.\n"We won\'t affect Macau. Macau\'s speciality is in the Formula Three, our aim is to host Formual One and the GT (Global Touring) Rally," Yu Binglin, vice-mayor of Zhuhai, said in a recent interview.\nElf, one of the event\'s major sponsors, said there was no reason for it to pull out of Macau even though another race track has sprung up in China.\n"Macau has a history of automobile racing. As long as Formula Three Grand Prix exists in Macau, Elf will be present in Macau. Business and selling products is one thing, sport is another," Michael Bonnet, Elf\'s director of commercial activities told Reuters.\n"What we wish to build in Asia are several (motor racing) schools to develop young drivers from Macau and rest of Asia ... we want to find potential champions in Asia."\nElf sponsored a Formula Campus Challenge in early November at the China Zhuhai 1996 International Race.\nRoyal/Dutch Shell, which lost its bid as fuel sponsor to Elf in 1995, said it would tender for the 1997 Macau race.\n"Macau and Zhuhai have their individual merits, like individual tenders. Macau belongs to our Hong Kong business (budget) rather than China. We\'ll try to do it next year," Albert Wong, a spokesman for Shell, said earlier last week.\nBut China, which is determined to muscle its way into the glamourous circuit of international motor racing, is expected to give Macau a good run for its money.\nZhuhai, just 15 km (9 miles) northeast of Macau, boasts a 4.32 km dedicated racing circuit.\nThe Federation Internationale de L\'Automobile (FIA) is conducting a study on whether its is up to standard for endorsement as a suitable Formula One venue.\nFIA is also discussing with Chinese officials Zhuhai\'s possible hosting of a Formula One race in 1997, a senior Zhuhai government said.\n"What Zhuhai has done is that it has opened up a whole new area of sponsorship. People who hadn\'t sponsored car racing before seem to be coming to Zhuhai to see if there\'s a possibility of being involved in sponsorship," de Kantzow said.\n'

a(S'Parcels giant DHL Worldwide Express, which has had its foot through the door of Eastern and Central Europe since the mid-1980s, was braced to break even on growing regional business by 2000, a senior executive said.\n"I would say that certainly by the year 2000 we would be in a breakeven position as a region in its own right," said Peter Davies, regional director of the European rim, during an interview with Reuters on Monday.\nTurnover generated from DHL\'s business in Eastern and Central Europe, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), would total US$155 million in 1996 compared with US$110 million in 1995, and hit US$200 million in 1997.\nThe breakeven comes after years of losses from the late 1980s when the region plunged into massive changes with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the break up of the former Soviet Union.\nDavies, responsible for Eastern and Central Europe including the CIS, said DHL was well aware of short-term difficulties but had maintained operations in the region with its sights set on the long term.\n"If you go into the market to make a fast buck, then you are in there for the wrong reason...you have to have a long term view to that," Davies said.\n"DHL doesn\'t make a profit as such, but it\'s okay, we know that. We have a long-term investment plan," he said.\nBut staying power of the company, which employs some 3,500 people in the region, might just be starting to pay off having captured 75 percent of market share there.\nGrowing foreign investments by its clients in the more mature economies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as well as the CIS have meant more business, Davies said.\nAnd in places like the former Yugoslavia where basic infrastructure and services were not well in place, delivery services were seen as particularly critical, he said.\nThe company has invested some US$46 million through expanding facilities and aircraft purchases in 1996 for Eastern and Central Europe and topped off another seven percent of the amount in training.\nIt now operates in 165 locations in the region and would add another 35 stations in 1997, Davies said.\n"We have invested much, especially in the countryside and the next stage would be expansion of facilities," he said.\n--HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 28436441\n'

a(S'Hong Kong\'s colonial Governor Chris Patten on Monday refused a request by future leader Tung Chee-hwa to support the interim legislature China will install in the territory when the British depart next year.\nShipping magnate Tung, emerging from his first meeting with Patten since being chosen on December 11 by a China-controlled committee to head Hong Kong from next July 1, told reporters that Patten flatly refused to provide any help to the new legislature in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty to China.\n"I brought up the work of the provisional legislature. I hope Mr Patten and the Hong Kong government can give help," Tung told reporters outside Government House, Patten\'s residence.\n"But Mr Patten\'s position was very clear. I didn\'t successfully convince him," Tung said.\nBoth men emerged from a 1-1/2 hour meeting to exchange hearty handshakes and make brief speeches to the press, but mentioned little else of what transpired behind closed doors.\nDescribing the discussion as "long and constructive", both said they agreed to meet in the future when the need arose.\nPatten, looking serious next to Tung, managed the occasional smile for photographers but turned to lead Tung into a waiting car immediately after his successor completed his short speech.\nNeither of them took questions.\nMonday\'s meeting was conducted under a cloud of strained Sino-British relations after China snubbed British objections and went ahead last Saturday with naming the provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legislative Council (Legco) when Hong Kong returns to Chinese control 190 days from now.\nThe interim assembly was designed by China to reverse electoral reforms that Patten introduced unilaterally in recent years.\nThe move came under an international spotlight after British Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind on Friday challenged China to let the World Court rule on the legality of the new assembly.\nPatten also lashed out at the new lawmaking body on Saturday, calling its appointment by a 400-member Selection Committee "a bizarre farce" and a "stomach-churning" process.\n"What it shows about China is that, here it is taking over responsibility for a First World economy but they\'re trying to foist on us political institutions which a Third World country would reject," Patten had said.\n"Here we are having foisted on us institutions which, frankly, you wouldn\'t try to run a tennis club with," he said.\nChina, however, has warned Britain against creating problems and to keep out of Hong Kong\'s affairs after the handover.\n"After 1997, Hong Kong will be an internal affair of China. No foreign countries can interfere with China\'s internal affair," China\'s envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, told reporters.\n"Whether Britain wants to accept my advice is up to it. But if it wants to create more new trouble, I don\'t think it will be out of the ordinary," he said on Monday at a public function.\nThe controversial new body is dominated by pro-Beijing figures, including 33 incumbent lawmakers and many politicians who lost to pro-democracy candidates in the 1995 Legco election.\nThe Democratic Party, the biggest single winner in last year\'s election with 19 of the 60 Legco seats, boycotted the creation of the provisional body, branding it undemocratic.\nThe Provisional Legislative Council, as it will be known, is to sit from July 1 until a new legislature can be created via elections.\n'

a(S'Britain\'s Home Office has warned ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong that they will not get British passports when the colony is handed over to China if they relinquished other passports in order to qualify.\nIn a statement made available late on Friday, the British government said applicants should be solely British before February 4, when the plan to grant full passports to 8,000 ethnic minority Hong Kong residents was announced.\n"This means that anyone voluntarily renouncing another nationality on or after that date will not qualify," it said.\nHong Kong\'s ethnic minorities had previously faced the threat of becoming stateless when China resumes sovereignty over the British colony of over 150 years at midnight on June 30.\nWhile they will have residency rights in Hong Kong after the handover, it was unclear whether they would be entitled passports of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\nBut the condition set down by Britain is widely seen as an attempt to plug a loophole after local newspapers reported some ethnic minority residents were ditching their other passports in the hope of qualifying for full British ones.\nA prominent business leader in Hong Kong\'s Indian community on Saturday slammed the February 4 cut-off.\n"This is not the right attitude of the British government. They shouldn\'t give conditions to it. They should give full passports without any clauses," Nari Dadlani told Reuters by telephone.\nDadlani, a naturalised Hong Kong resident of 38 years who holds no other passport, said he would stay on in Hong Kong even if he was to be granted full British citizenship.\n"What we need is only an insurance, when emergencies arise. We are not going to take the first flight to London with this passport...we are much more happy here in Hong Kong," he said.\n"And even when it comes to that, the Indian community is going to take a lot of capital to the U.K. We are not going to ask for social security and such things," Dadlani said.\nIn its statement, the British Home Office said necessary legislation would first need to be enacted before those concerned, mostly Indians and Pakistanis, could apply to become British citizens.\nApplicants should be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong and they, including spouses and children, must qualify in their own right, it said\nSuccessful applicants would be granted full British citizenship from July 1, the statement said.\n'

a(S'Hong Kong lined up on Thursday to pay its respects to China\'s dead leader Deng Xiaoping.\nColonial Governor Chris Patten was one of the first to be escorted inside the Xinhua news agency, Beijing\'s de facto mission in Hong Kong, to offer his condolences. Deng died late on Wednesday at the age of 92.\n"I have written to director Zhou Nan, the head of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), expressing my condolences and of course if there is a condolence book opened I will want to sign that with the senior members of my administration," Patten told reporters before going in.\nAsked if he would sent flowers, he replied: "I don\'t think that would be appropriate."\nThere has been little love lost between Government House and Xinhua during Patten\'s four-and-a-half-year tenure as the 28th and last British Governor of Hong Kong.\nChina denounced Patten as a political prostitute, a criminal for one thousand years and worse for spearheading democratic reforms in the twilight of British rule.\nChina plans to undo his reforms by dissolving Hong Kong\'s elected legislature and replacing it with an interim appointed chamber.\nPatten was followed on Thursday by the man who will step into his shoes when the colony is handed over to China at the stroke of midnight on June 30, now just 131 days away.\nFuture leader Tung Chee-hwa, flanked by members of his inner cabinet, bowed three times to a large black and white photograph of Deng.\nHong Kong\'s politically powerful billionaires and new generation of pro-Beijing politicians turned up in force and were reverently ushered in.\nAn elderly couple, however, jumped the gun.\nThey turned up early in the morning, before Xinhua had managed to make arrangements for mourners for the man whose reforms transformed China from a weak, impoverished nation to an emerging economic powerhouse.\nThey were told to come back in the afternoon.\nFive demonstrators staged a brief protest against Deng who they described as "the Butcher of Beijing" for his role in the brutal crushing of the student-led pro-democracy movement centred on Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.\n"One man has just died, but so many are mourning for him. Don\'t forget the number of people who died on June 4," they said.\n'

a(S'America Online Inc., responding to the competion posed by the Internet, said Tuesday it would reorganize its business and unveiled a flat-rate $19.95-a-month pricing plan.\nThe world\'s biggest online services company said it was taking $460 million in charges this year as it restructures its operations.\nAs part of its reorganization, AOL plans to separate into three operating units -- AOL Networks, to oversee its flagship Internet online service; AOL Studios, for creating online programming; and ANS Communications, its network arm, the Dulles, Va.-based company said.\nAOL said it would begin offering a number of new pricing options, including a flat monthly rate of $19.95 for unlimited access. The pricing action, which was widely expected, matches the recent pricing by Microsoft Corp. when it re-launched the Microsoft Network and the rates of Internet access providers.\nAs part of its restructuring, AOL named Robert Pittman, former chief exectutive of MTV Networks, to oversee AOL Networks. Pittman, most recently chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate Corp., had forged MTV into the first profitable basic cable network company.\nPittman also headed Time Warner\'s Inc.\'s Six Flags amusement park chain, where he oversaw four straight years of record growth in attendance, revenues and earnings, AOL said.\nThe company said it was taking a $385 million charge in its fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, to account for deferred subscriber acquisition costs, an accounting method for which it has been heavily criticised by Wall Street.\nAOL also said it plans to take a one-time charge of up to $75 million in the current quarter for costs it expects to incur as it reorganizes.\nAOL\'s stock, which recently moved to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq market, jumped $1 to $25.675 and it was among the most active issues on the NYSE, as Wall Street applauded its rejigging of its accounting methods.\n"We are moving to remove this distraction from earnings," AOL Chairman Steve Case told reporters on a conference call. "The focus here is to simplify how people really look at this business. We are confident that people will see the underlying momentum."\nAnalysts do expect some pressure on the company\'s gross profits as a result of the new pricing, but they said the moves were necessary to compete with the growing pressures from Internet access providers and to keep its subscribers.\nAOL expects to report a second fiscal quarter loss, break-even in the March quarter and return to profitability in the quarter ending in June, its fourth fiscal quarter.\n"It\'s a very bold, clever and necessary set of moves by America Online to get their financial house in order and reposition themselves as a diversified media company," said Adam Schoenfeld, a vice president at Jupiter Communications.\n"AOL was for a long time able to ignore the going rate and market vicissitudes because of its pre-eminent position, but those positions only last so long," Schoenfeld added.\nAOL said the company added nearly 250,000 net new subscribers in October as it began to address some of the customer retention problems it encountered during the traditionally slower summer months.\nCase said the company was still on target for reaching its 10 million subscribers sometime during calendar 1997.\n"The phones have been ringing off the hook today from people who are eager to subscribe to the new AOL," Case said. "We now believe we have the strategy in place and a team in place to take AOL to the next level."\nTed Leonsis, who currently heads AOL Services Co., was named to head the newly formed AOL Studios, and Bruce Bond, hired this year to lead ANS Communications, will continue in his current role with that unit.\nAOL said its new, more competitive pricing structure would take effect immediately.\nThe plans calls for two unlimited pricing tiers to provide a "comfort factor" for heavy and medium users, and a $4.95 plan for light users. AOL said it will offer a standard monthly plan for unlimited AOL use, including Internet access, for $19.95.\nIt will also offer advance-payment rates of $14.95 a month for customers who pay for two years, and $17.95 per month for those who pay in advance for one year.\nThe company also said it will charge a "bring-your-own-access" rate of $9.95 per month, offering unlimited access to the proprietary content available only on AOL to people who already have a separate Internet access connection.\nAOL will also offer a light-usage programme providing three hours of AOL a month for $4.95, with additional time priced at $2.50 per hour.\n'

a(S'CompuServe Corp is expected to announce on Thursday that it is dissolving its Wow! consumer online service as it gives up on the consumer market and refocuses on the corporate market, industry sources said.\nA spokesman for the Columbus, Ohio based company declined to comment, saying he could not comment in advance of a "strategic announcement" CompuServe plans early Thursday.\nThe struggling online services company has been under more pressure in recent months from America Online Inc, the Microsoft Corp Network and Internet access providers.\nThe company plans to halt its marketing aimed at consumers and it will expand its emphasis on corporate customers in the U.S. and Europe. CompuServe will try to convert its 100,000 Wow! users to its core CompuServe Information Service and it will not abandon its current consumer users, sources said.\nBut it will not make the consumer business a key focus, as it cedes to the dominant America Online, which is growing its subscriber base again, after a hiccup in growth this summer.\nWall Street analysts said that such a move could entail some layoffs at CompuServe, and possibly a restructuring charge to cover Wow! employees who cannot be reassigned.  \nCompuServe\'s move comes on the heels of some recent aggressive actions by AOL to stay on top with its plans to shut down its GNN direct Internet access and its announcement to cut its workforce by 300 employees and take a $75 million charge in its second fiscal quarter.\nAOL also announced flat-rate pricing of $19.95 a month for unlimited access, bowing to the competition from Internet access providers and their flat monthly rates of $19.95.\nCompuServe\'s Wow! service is a flat-rate service, for $17.95 a month, but it could not be learned if CompuServe will change the pricing of its core CIS service as it dissolves Wow.  \nCompuServe hopes to move all its Wow! subscribers over to its core service by the end of January.\n"They have a separate productions staff, separate marketing, etc," said Abhishek Gami, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities, adding however that CompuServe has tried to keep Wow! extremely lean and some employees will likely be moved to the main service or to SPRYNET, its Internet service.\nSince CompuServe went public in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from its initial offering price of $30 a share. Its shares now trade at around $11-5/8, since it has announced losses and a drop in subscribers.  \n"They have had a whole lot of problems since they went public," said one industry source. "They need to reposition the company."\nCompuServe is the second largest online service after America Online.\n'

a(S'Electronic commerce over the Internet - buying airplane tickets, music CDs, or clothes with a credit card - is not fiction anymore.\nBut security and other concerns hampered the Internet from becoming an international shopping mall in 1996, and security remains an issue for 1997.\nElectronic commerce in 1996 was not quite as robust as some firms had anticipated, as delays in developing the software to secure credit card transactions on the Net kept merchants and consumers at bay. E-commerce is still in its infancy and likely to explode toward the end of the century.\n"This was kind of a building year," said Scott Smith, a Jupiter Communications analyst. "Many consumers are just starting to get online, merchants are trying to still figure out how to present themselves online."\nAccording to Jupiter, total revenues generated from all consumer shopping over the Internet and online services will reach about $1.2 billion in 1996. The revenues are expected to almost double next year, to $2.3 billion.\nJupiter, a New York market research firm, forecasts 1999 revenues to jump to $5.5 billion and to $7.3 billion in 2000.\nTravel and the direct distribution of electronic products, such as PCs, software, etc., are the two biggest categories of electronic commerce right now, Smith said, with travel making up about half of the $1.2 billion in 1996 commerce revenues.\nMost of the giant retailers are sitting by the sidelines, watching and waiting for the security to be in place and to see what some of the catalog merchants and other more daring retailers are doing on the Internet, where there are many opportunities to save costs, keep inventories low and target customers with specific products aimed at their profiles.\n"It\'s inventing whole new ways of selling stuff," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, the head of International Business Machines Corp.\'s Internet division.\nIBM has developed a shopping mall called World Avenue, where mostly speciality retailers have storefronts.It also includes Express, the popular unit of Limited Inc.\nBut still, Internet shopping is not viewed by consumers as completely safe. A recent study by O\'Reilly &amp; Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., reported that fewer than 1 percent of all public World Wide Web sites are fully able to host secure transactions.\n"It\'s easy enough to know that if you get a warning from your browser that what you are about to do is dangerous...that this is a deterrant," said Richard Peck, a vice president at O\'Reilly "Commerce readiness is an issue of consumer trust, confidence."\nCredit card companies MasterCard International and Visa International have been working together since last February on software to secure credit card transactions, using data encryption (scrambling) techniques and authentication software to ensure identities of the consumer, the merchant and the Web site.\nBut the software development is behind, analysts and industry executives said, even though the protocols (the roadmap for software developers) called the SET (secure electronic transaction) specification have been published.\nThe companies had said in February they expected banks to be able to offer secure bankcard services via the Internet to their cardholders in the fourth quarter 1996.\n"They have totally blown that deadline out of the water," Smith of Jupiter said. "There was a bit of hype about it originally that made people think it would be done really fast." Smith said the development has many diverse layers.\n"There are issues that have to be sorted out. It probably won\'t be until 1998 when it is fully implemented," Smith said.\nVisa did not return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for MasterCard in Purchase, N.Y. said that the companies remain "on track" with their original timeframes, but that MasterCard had no news since a recent announcement.\nLast month, MasterCard purchased 51 percent of Mondex International Inc., a leading electronic payment system using a payment card called a smart card, which are like electronic wallets. A group of banks and AT&amp;T endorsed the electronic cash card, with pilot testing already going on in some cities.\nSmart cards will likely become one of the many ways consumers pay for purchases online. PCs will have built-in smart card readers, specifically designed for online buys.\nSo while the SET software is still in development, companies are finding other ways to do transactions.\nCyberCash, which is also a partner working on the SET transaction system, is providing encryption software for America Online Inc\'s Web hosting service, so that small or large companies selling goods can have a secure credit card payment system, based on data encryption software currently available.\n"SET isn\'t really all there yet," said Doug McKee, manager of Web server development at AOL. "Cybercash has a system that is like a proprietary version of SET...I don\'t think there is a reason to wait."\nSome companies are not waiting. While the big retail giants slowly enter cyberspace, a new breed of Internet retailers and brands are being born, like Amazon.com, the popular site bookseller and Onsale.com, an auction house for computers and consumer electronics goods.\n'

a(S'One of the hottest topics at a recent Internet trade show was so-called "push technology," which directly broadcasts customised news to computer users hooked up to the Net -- but is also seen as the next area ripe for a shakeout     Internet broadcasters are led by companies\nlike privately held PointCast Inc., which announced a major deal with software giant Microsoft Corp. early last month.\nCupertino, Calif.-based PointCast and several other start-up companies deliver customised news -- or specific Web sites, depending on the service -- to consumer or corporate computer users, up to several times a day.\nIn other words, instead of searching the Web for the information they want, computer users have it sent directly to them.\nThe Yankee Group, a Boston research firm, predicts that by the year 2000 Internet broadcasting will be worth $5.7 billion in revenues. It now represents about $10 million in revenues a year.\n"Making the Internet a broadcast medium is a direction that a lot of companies are going in, but that\'s already really crowded," said Ted Julian, an analyst with IDC Corp.\nAt the Internet World trade show, four of the best-known push technology companies exhibited and demonstrated their services, trying to differentiate themselves amid all the hype about direct Internet broadcasting.\nBut analysts said there are anywhere from 20 to 30 start-ups in this burgeoning area, as many companies are betting the concept will further change the World Wide Web and gain new advertiser interest.\n"This is the new Web," said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at MecklerMedia Corp., host of the Internet World show.\nPointCast was the first company to develop what are called personalized broadcast systems, and it now has 1.7 million subscribers. It delivers news from The New York Times, Boston Globe, Reuters Holdings Plc., and now MSNBC, the cable television-online news venture of Microsoft and General Electric Co.\'s NBC.\nPointCast and most of the other start-up companies operate on the same advertising-based model. They sell advertising space on their service and offer the service for free to subscribers.\nBy building up lots of subscribers, they can gain more advertising revenue.\nThe deal PointCast signed with Microsoft has the potential to significantly expand its subscriber base because PointCast will become part of Microsoft\'s next-generation computer desktop. Microsoft plans to incorporate its Internet Explorer Web browser in its next version of its Windows operating system, which dominates its market.\nIn a study last month, the Yankee Group said the Internet broadcasting market will significantly affect the way companies collect advertising dollars on the Web.\n"The Web is hitting a wall" in terms of people signing up for paid subscriptions for information, said analyst Melissa Bain of the Yankee Group. "The Wall Street Journal (Interactive Edition) is successful, but not every content provider has had success. Users can get the information elsewhere for free."\nBain said that, according to her report, 51 percent of all online users surveyed said that they typically access or use the same Web sites on a daily basis, making the "push" model attractive.\nBut with many more companies arriving on the scene and Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp. getting into the market, consolidation is on the horizon, because media companies will not want to develop a channel for each delivery system, most of which, for now, are proprietary.\n"There is no way I am going to download all four of these, and I am in the industry," said Jerry Yang, one of the founders of search engine power Yahoo! Corp. "This is a huge issue."\nBut Yang said that Yahoo! and other Internet search engines are looking at push technology because it will enhance a user\'s experience with the Web.\n"Look for Yahoo to do a lot of development with one of these companies, or a Yahoo!-branded push channel," Yang said in a recent interview. "We will all experiment."\nAt Internet World, StarWave Corp., one of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\'s many investments, demonstrated a service it plans to introduce sometime next year.

a(S'Computer makers are expected to report solid fourth-quarter earnings in what is normally the strongest quarter of the year, but the stronger dollar will hurt some big systems makers.\nDespite all the negative reports from computer retailers about lackluster personal computer sales, analysts said most U.S. PC makers -- with the exception of Apple Computer Inc. and AST Research Inc. -- will show strong sales growth, fuelled by hefty corporate buying.\nApple is the first to report, with first-quarter results due late on Wednesday.\nEarlier this month, Cupertino, California-based Apple forecast it would report an operating loss for its first quarter ended last month, citing weak U.S. demand for its Performa consumer PC and continued shortages of notebook computers.\nChip-maker Intel Corp, powered by surging demand for its Pentium and Pentium Pro microprocessors, reported on Tuesday its fourth quarter profits more than doubled to $1.9 billion, exceeding even Wall Street\'s most optimistic estimates.\n"Most of the indications are that business throughout the (PC) sector, other than Apple, was strong," said Dean Witter analyst Eugene Glazer. "With all the negative comments you are hearing from retailers, some of that market was going to the direct marketers" like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc.\nAnalysts said the world\'s largest PC maker, Compaq Computer Corp, was likely to report strong earnings, especially after semiconductor giant Intel Corp. reported a blowout fourth quarter, surpassing Wall Street predictions.\nCompaq gets about 20 percent or so of its revenues via store sales to consumers and the rest of its revenues from sales to corporate customers, which were booming.\n"The consumer business didn\'t hurt them," said Jim Poyner, an Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst. "Dell and Compaq are benefiting from the same forces, the transition to the Pentium Pro (chip), a hot notebook (computer) market and progress in the server (network computer) business."\nOn the larger systems side, companies like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Unisys Corp. are expected to see some negative impact from a stronger dollar overseas and sluggish sales in Europe, while business in the United States remains strong.\n"Business is quite good in the U.S.," said Jay Stevens, another Dean Witter analyst. "Where it\'s slower, or where the concerns have been expressed, is overseas, mostly in Europe."\nDigital is expected to report a slight profit as it slowly recovers from sales force problems in Europe and a money-losing PC business. PCs are expected to break even.\n"I think it will be a good quarter," said Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich.\nAnalysts said that they expected IBM\'s earnings to be a bit better than expected, but that its expenses for job cuts will be greater than previous quarters.\n"Europe remains a slower grower, which has led to a number of organisational and planned efficiency changes," said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst. IBM reports its earnings next Tuesday.\n'

a(S'Britain\'s Lloyds Chemists said on Friday it was unable to advise shareholders what action to take on a renewed bid offer from UniChem until it had heard from rival suitor Gehe AG.\n"What we will now need to do is to see if we can ascertain Gehe\'s intentions," finance director Johnathan Fellows said in an interview.\nBoth UniChem\'s original bid for the pharmacy chain and a rival offer from German pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe AG lapsed in March after being referred to Britain\'s Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of competition fears.\n"We have no comment at this stage. We need to meet as a board and we clearly need to have some correspondence with our shareholders. We have not yet resolved what recommendations to make," Fellows said.\n"I would hope to make an announcement in the next few days."\nNews of UniChem\'s renewed offer sent Lloyds shares to a record high of 523p, before slipping back to 518p, up 13-1/2p on the day. UniChem shares fell 6p to 250. Gehe shares trading in Frankfurt were off two marks at 109 marks.\nGehe, whose lapsed offer was an all cash bid pitched at 500 pence per share, said it planned an announcement later in the day.\nUniChem, which already owns 9.9 percent of Lloyds, is offering 16 new UniChem shares and 926p in cash for every 10 Lloyds shares. That values the company at 657.6 million pounds ($1.04 billion).\nUniChem also said it had identified cost savings and revenue benefits "conservatively" estimated at more than 15 million pounds in the 12 months after an acquisition and in excess of 20 million pounds a year thereafter.\nAs well as cost-savings UniChem said the acquisition would enable faster development of its retail pharmacy business and be earnings enhancing after 12 months.\n"We believe that our extensive retail expertise, together with our unparalleled pharmaceutical wholesale distribution capabilities, will greatly enhance both businesses," said Jeffery Harris, chief executive of UniChem.\nThe offer was announced shortly after Britain\'s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) cleared the way for a takeover of Lloyds, providing UniChem and Gehe fulfill promises to sell off certain parts of Lloyds.\n"UniChem and GEHE have each identified a number of potential firm buyers for the businesses they are required to divest. These have been approved by the minister," said the DTI.\nIf either UniChem or Gehe are successful in acquiring Lloyds, they must sell off specified Lloyds\' wholesale businesses within three months of the completed merger, the department said.\nLloyds Chemists, owns the second largest chain of retail pharmacies in Britain with more than 900 outlets. UniChem is one of the two largest wholesalers of pharmaceutical products in Britain and also owns a chaon of some 400 retail pharmacies.\nGehe, Europe\'s largest drug distributor, is keen to expand its pharmaceutical retail business in Britain which it entered with the acquisition of AAH Plc in April.

a(S'Ice cream had a sad time in Europe this summer, adding fresh impetus for the big makers to try to persuade us to eat it in the winter.\n"We think for Unilever its meant 125 million pounds ($198.4 million) in lost sales and lost profits of 50 million in the summer months across europe," said David Lang, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.\nThe dull summer has hit impulse purchases of ice creams worst of all, a high-margin sector that makes up one third of all European ice cream sales.\nCoca-Cola, sometimes taken as a benchmark for consumer spending behaviour, reported a 10 percent decline in case sales in Germany, 17 percent down in Britain and four percent down in France as a result of the poor summer.\nIt\'s no surprise then to find marketing executives at Wall\'s and Nestle scurrying for new products to sell in the winter months.\nBritain\'s Birds Eye Wall\'s, owned by Unilever, said it has launched seven new lines across its impulse, take-home and multipack sectors as chocolate indulgences for the winter months.\nNestle is trying to roll out products like its Christmas Log in France to even out the seasonal swing in sales.\nBoth companies argue if people in Norway and Sweden, where the climate is cooler, can eat twice as much ice cream than in Britain, then there is work to be done.\n"The snag is that in summer when people are on holiday that is when impulse sales are always at their highest, people just don\'t associate having an ice cream with winter," said John Campbell, an analyst at Paribas.\nIndustry watchers also point out that children, who account for 40 percent of all impulse icecream sales, take their longest holidays in the summer.\nWall\'s, the largest player in the British icecream market worth about 1.0 billion pounds estimates some 60 million pounds of the market growth in 1995 came from the very hot summer.\nWall\'s brands account for 17 out of the top 20 selling impulse brands with Wall\'s Solero heading up the league followed by Magnum White and Magnum Classic.\nIn terms of total market share Wall\'s has 43 percent in Britain, Nestle Lyons Maid 12 percent, Mars 7 percent, own label 29 percent and others 9 percent.\nIn a week of indifferent summer weather Wall\'s sells about 23 to 25 million portions of icecream whereas in a hot sunny week this figure can rise to around 55 million portions.\nThe big players in the 15 billion pounds European icecream market have come down with a thud from the summer of 1995.\nIt was the third hottest summer on record in Europe and August the hottest and sunniest ever -- with long periods of temperatures above 16 degrees centigrade, at which point consumers really switch into buying icecream.\nTemperatures soared to an average 17.5 degrees centigrade in Britain with 7.8 hours of sunshine a day compared with 7.2 hours in 1996. Statistics from the MetOffice, Britain\'s national weather centre, show an average temperature of 15.9 degrees for the summer of 1996. The office says the South of France and Spain had just an average summer this year.\nNestle, who entered the UK market in 1992 with the purchase of the Lyons Maid brand, estimates total sales in Britain are down some 5 percent at 879 million due to the dull summer, of this hand held icecreams accounted for 489 million.\nIn Britain the all-time Summer record for Wall\'s still stands at 71 million portions sold during one week in the long, hot summer of 1976 -- the year when Wall\'s Cornetto first hit the market.\nHowever much the big fridge fillers spend on advertising and dreaming up new products it will be hard to break that record.\n($1=.6299 Pound)\n'

a(S'B.A.T Industries, reporting a nine percent rise in nine-month profits, on Wednesday ruled out a demerger of its tobacco business despite conceding that U.S. tobacco litigation was the main issue affecting its share price.\nChief executive Martin Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.\nA strategy review showed "there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger," he told Reuters.\nProfits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.\nTrading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.\nWorldwide cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.\nThe growing pace of litigation claims against the company\'s U.S. cigarette subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson (B&amp;W), and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T\'s share price.\nB.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to below 430 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company\'s stockmarket value along the way.\nBroughton said a demerger of Brown &amp; Williamson would be "highly destructive" of shareholder value, adding there was "no question" that the board of directors was united on the issue.\nHe also played down fears over U.S. litigation. Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.\nIn the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&amp;W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.\nB.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.\nLawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.\nB.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\'s attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.\nIf the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as "medical devices" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.\nResponding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.\n"We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal," he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.\nTurning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.\nIn financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, the Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.\nIt also suffered a 91 million pounds charge for a surge in asbestos and pollution claims in the United States.\nThe life insurance and investment business reported a five percent increase in profit.\nShares in the company initially rose after the results, but later fell back to close at 427-1/2p pence, down 8-1/2p.

But we cannot afford buybacks at the moment.

a(S'Britain\'s largest brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle Plc will see more benefit from its Courage brands in its half year results due on Monday, but its holiday village business Center Parcs will hold it back, analysts said.\n"The company will see an improvement from a full contribution at Courage, but what is really holding it back is Center Parcs and there could be a worry on the currency with the recent strength in the pound," said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr.\nAnalysts forecasts for pretax profits range from 178 to 198 million stg up from 154.5 million last time.  \nDividend forecasts centre on 7.0p. Brewing is expected to contribute some 80 million stg, with 45 million of this total anticipated from Courage. Courage made just 9.0 million stg in operating profit, on turnover of 298.9 million stg, to overall group profits in the first half of 1995.\nS&amp;N acquired Courage from Australian brewer Foster\'s in August, 1995 to create Britain\'s largest brewing group in a deal that cost about 550 million stg. Since then S&amp;N has quickly set about reducing its brewing capacity by some 1.5 million barrels a year, initially by closing two breweries and shedding some 1,600 jobs.  \nJohn Smith\'s Courage is now Britain\'s leading ale brand.\nThe group\'s Center Parcs holiday resorts are expected to suffer from continued weak consumer leisure spending in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Center Parcs made operating profit of 82.0 million stg in the year to April 28, 1995 down 2.1 percent on turnover of 365.3 million. S&amp;N\'s new village at Bispinger Heide in Germany was opened against a very weak economic background in July 1995 and the cost of opening was higher than the company expected.  \nPontin\'s, S&amp;N\'s other leisure brand, made trading profits of 3.6 million, down from 4.1 million due to the sale of four sites and major refurbishment work at two others.\nThe performance of its Center Parc villages in the Netherlands and Belgium were adversely affected by a lack of consumer confidence and cut price competition from operators and it responded by investing heavily in those countries.\nAnalysts expect this trend to have carried on into the first half of the year, forcing the leisure division to report profits down some 5.0 million at 45 million.  \nThe company has three Center Parcs in Britain at Nottingham in the Midlands, East Anglia and Longleat, in the west of England. It owns two in France, one in Germany, two in Belgium and six in Holland.\nHowever, S&amp;N\'s retail division, which includes the 1,600 strong chain of Chef &amp; Brewer restaurants, should see trading profits improve by increased investment aimed at rebranding and lifting the image of some outlets.\nThe company\'s managed pub estate has been rebranded to include pub-cafe bars like Rat &amp; Parrot and entertainment pubs like Big Hand Mo.  \nThe consensus of analysts forecasts for profits from the retail division rests at 88 million stg, up some 8.0 million on the first half of 1995. The division includes an estate of 740 tenanted and about 1,850 managed pubs as well as Chef &amp; Brewer.\nThe company\'s shares have outperformed its peers by about eight percent since February, but started underperforming the FTSE100 index by some six percent since late September.\nThe shares were up 142p at 642 on Friday from their 500p close on January 3. Return on equity is currently running at 5.62 percent, half its 11.32 percent level in 1995, against 10.44 percent currently for Bass.  \nOperating margins have fallen to 12.27 percent from 15.46 percent in 1995.\nA Reuter poll of 23 brokers estimates produced a consensus estimate EPS of 44.8 for the year ended April 28, 1997 rising to 49.5 for year end 1998.\n-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437\n'

a(S'British pub to hotels group Greenalls Plc should report a near 20 percent rise in its full year profits on Thursday as its acquisition of Boddington Group feeds through into its managed pub estate, analysts said.\nAnalysts\' forecasts for pretax profits in the year to September 27 range from 145 to 150 million stg excluding an exceptional 30 million stg for the cost of reorganising Boddington\'s, up from 100.5 million last time. Dividend forecasts are centred on a total payout of 15.4p.  \nThe acquisition of Boddington for 527 million stg in November 1995 added 458 pubs to the group\'s portfolio and made Greenalls the largest independent retail pub chain with 2,370 outlets. Some 270 former Boddington\'s managed pubs were absorbed into Greenalls Inns.\nAt the time of the acquisition Greenalls identified 18 million stg of cost savings from closing Boddington\'s offices and wholesale depots.\nHowever, confusion remains among analysts about how former Boddington assets have been absorbed.  \nTrading profits from its managed pubs are anticipated to be up some 45 percent at 76 million stg, driven by the inclusion of the Boddington estate for the first full year.\nProfits from its hotel and restaurants division should grow about 10 percent to 58 million. The company announced the long-awaited sale of its six hotels in the United States on Friday for 14 million stg in cash with a loss on the disposal of 1.75 million.\n"It\'s definitely a welcome sight to see. Those hotels have rarely been in profit over the last ten years," said one analyst who declined to be named.  \nThe division also includes De Vere Hotels, Village Leisure -- acquired from Boddington -- and the branded Premier House pub restaurants.\nEarnings from the group\'s tenanted pubs and wholesaling are likely to be up about 25 percent at 50 million. At the end of August, Inn Partnership comprised 1,194 tenanted houses including 145 former Boddington tenanted pubs.\nThis division also includes 460 off-licenses and a distillery.\nAnalysts envisage an interest charge of about 38 million.  \nInvestors and analysts are keen to hear how the brands acquired from Boddington\'s are fitting in.\n"There are a number of retail brands in this vastly enlarged group and it would be interesting to see which ones it considers to be really important for the future, " said Colin Humphreys, analyst at Panmure Gordon.\nGreenalls shares were off 6p at 596 on Friday at 1100 GMT, well off their 637p year high. The company improved operating margin to 17.6 percent in 1995 from 16.75 percent a year earlier.  \nIts return on equity rose to 13.15 percent from 10.39 over the same period, compared with 9.84 percent for Whitbread.\nA Reuter poll of 24 brokers produced a consensus estimate EPS for the full year ending September 27, 1996 of 38.5 rising to 42.5 in 1997.\n-- London Newsroom +44 71 542 6437\n'

a(S'Britain on Monday referred brewer to leisure group Bass Plc\'s acquisition of Carlsberg-Tetley (C-T) to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation but analysts said they believed the deal would go through once certain conditions had been met.\n"Mr Lang (British Trade &amp; Industry Minister) considers that the merger gives rise to competition concerns in relation to the significant increase in concentration of production in the UK brewing industry," the Department of Trade &amp; Industry said in a statement.\nBass acquired half of C-T from Allied Domecq for 200 million pounds ($328 million) in August and declared its plan to buy the rest of the company from Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S, in exchange for Carlsberg taking 20 percent in the merged company.\nBritain\'s MMC will investigate whether a full merger of the two companies would operate against the public interest. It will report by March 24, 1997.\nIf approved, the merger would create Britain\'s largest brewer by far, with at least 35 percent of the market. Bass now has a 23 percent market share.\nRival brewers and analysts widely expected a referral to the MMC because of the dominance it would give the merged group in setting beer prices in some regions.\nBass shares fell about 6p on the news to 783p but recovered to close 14-1/2p higher at 803-1/2p as analysts said they expected the Bass deal to go through with conditions imposed, given the force of growing competition in the industry and brewing over-capacity.\nBut they added Lang will be in no rush to approve the deal so close to a general election due before May 1.\n"They will probably try to defer the decision until after the election. I don\'t think they want the negative PR of having a large number of people fired," said Lehman Brothers analyst John Wakeley.\nFormer Trade and Industry secretary Michael Heseltine, accredited with nodding through Scottish and Newcastle\'s (S&amp;N) acquisition of Courage from Australian brewer Foster\'s 18 months ago without an MMC referral, was operating mid-way through the Conservative Party\'s term in office.\nHis stance on competition policy was also widely viewed by analysts as more laissez-faire than that of Lang.\n"Clearly there is a very strong element of politics. And it is certainly more subject to politics than the last decision on S&amp;N for Courage," said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr.\nAnalysts expect the MMC to require Bass to sell about 1,000 of its pubs, it currently owns about 4,200, and to cull its brand porfolio. It may be required to sell more pubs in areas where it is especially dominant.\nA combination of these two conditions would reduce Bass\' market share to around 35 percent from about 40 percent if the deal was allowed to go ahead unconditionally.\nBrian Revell, Transport and General Workers Union national secretary for the drinks industry, welcomed the decision to refer the Bass takeover.\n"Our main concern is that if the takeover is allowed to proceed, at least 2,000 jobs are likely to be lost," he said.\nA spokeswoman for Bass said the company hoped the MMC could make a hasty decision. "We are confident that more jobs will be safer at both companies if the merger goes ahead than would otherwise be the case," she added.\nBritain\'s Secretary of State has the power to refer to the MMC for investigation any proposed merger which creates or intensifies a market share of 25 percent of supply in Britain.\nBass was knocked off its perch as Britain\'s leading brewer last year when S&amp;N acquired Courage, giving it a 31 percent share of Britain\'s beer market.\nC-T was formed as a joint venture between Allied Domecq and Carlsberg A/S in 1992 by the merger of their British brewing and wholesaling businesses.\nBass announced the acquisition of Allied\'s 50 percent stake in August along with some 30 beer brands including Tetley Bitter and Skol, six breweries and C-T\'s network of depots.

a(S'While General Motors Corp. struggles to overcome labor costs of $43 an hour at its parts plants, the head of one global auto supplier is painting a Darwinian view of the future, in which an increasing number of workers earn less than $10 an hour.\nNearly one-quarter of ITT Automotive Inc.\'s workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly wage and benefit rate of less than $10 by 2000, the company\'s top executive said this week at a conference of suppliers.\nThat sobering forecast spotlights a long-term problem for GM, which is now in the throes of negotiating a new three-year labor contract with the United Auto Workers union.\n"They can\'t make a buck stamping out taillights and paying people $43 an hour," said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.\nAdds Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi: "Their 43 other competitors aren\'t going to say \'We\'ll spot you a couple of years.\'"\nTimothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, said the company paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers around the world less than $10 an hour in 1995. That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.\n"Do we do that because we\'re mean?" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. "No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction."\nFacing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.\nIn the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.\nEven if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. , GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.\nAbout 42 percent of Delphi\'s workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.\nDelphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM\'s North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.\nBut as Leuliette\'s comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.\nThe worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labor-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour. Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.\n"If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT," Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.\nITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.\nThe company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company\'s average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.\n'

a(S'Officials from Ford Motor Co pledged to review security measures Thursday after the fourth fatal shooting in two years at one of their facilities.\nBut executives from the automaker said there was little that plant security guards, who do not carry guns, could do to defend themselves against armed intruders.\n"When somebody blasts their way into a factory, it\'s very difficult to prevent," said Jacques Nasser, the executive vice president in charge of Ford\'s automotive operations.\nA gunman dressed in military fatigues shot his way into Ford\'s Wixom Assembly plant about 30 miles west of Detroit Thursday morning, according to police.\nThe man killed a manufacturing planning manager, 57-year old Darrell Izzard, and fired at people throughout the plant, sending workers fleeing in panic through the sprawling assembly complex.\nBefore it was over more than four hours later, several people, including two police officers, had been wounded.\nThe shooting came three months after a Ford worker shot and killed a security guard at Ford\'s Sheldon Road climate control plant in Plymouth, Mich. In January of 1995, another employee of the plant wounded his estranged wife and killed her boyfriend before killing himself.\nIn September 1994, a United Auto Worker union official killed two fellow union officials and wounded two others during a shooting at Ford\'s Rouge Manufacturing centre in Dearborn, Mich.\nThroughout Thursday, radio and television stations carried calls they said they received from hourly Ford workers who complained about the stressful work environment at the Wixom plant and other Ford facilities.\nBut Ford spokesman Jon Harmon pointed out the suspect in the Wixom shooting, identified as Gerald Atkins, 29, was not an employee of any Ford facility. Moreover, he noted it has not been uncommon in recent months for workers at Wixom to be idled because of slow demand for vehicles made at the plant.\nThe plant produces the Lincoln Town Car, Mark VIII and Continental cars, which have all been experiencing soft sales. About 3,000 hourly workers, members of United Auto Workers union Local 36, work at the facility.\nDuring a news conference, plant manager Jeff Haller described the plant\'s workforce as dedicated, hard-working and cohesive. He said the plant\'s security measures would be reviewed. Some workers told reporters they had not had their security badges checked in eight years.\nUAW Local 36 President Richard Greenfield said the union was saddened by the event and had set up a counselling line. He declined to comment on the day\'s events because the investigation had not been completed.\n'

No terms were announced for the deal, which had been expected for months.\n"Peregrine will be one of North America\'s premier automotive supply companies," Gulda said in a statement. "We expect to see signficant growth in the years ahead."\nGulda is a former chief executive officer of Kelsey-Hayes, a brake systems maker that is part of LucasVarity Plc.\nThe new company, to be based in Southfield, Mich., will pursue business with all car and truck manufacturers in North America and internationally, he said.\nPeregrine said that, following a final agreement expected by the end of 1996, it will sign a supply agreement with GM to address "current and future business."\nThe four plants produce a variety of interior parts, including hinges, door panels and instrument panels, and generate combined revenue of about $1 billion a year. Hourly and salaried workers at the plants total about 5,500.\nTwo of the plants, in Livonia and Flint, Mich., are part of GM\'s Delphi Interior &amp; Lighting Systems unit. The other two, a fabrication plant in Oshawa, Ontario, and a trim plant in Windsor, Ontario, report to both Delphi and GM of Canada.\nThe Michigan plants had been on a list of 12 U.S. Delphi operations GM had identified as being troubled facilities.\nSale of the Canadian plants became an issue in the three-week strike by members of the Canadian Auto Workers union. In the end, GM won the right to sell the two plants.\nWorkers not kept on by the new owner will be offered jobs at other GM facilities.\nPeregrine said in a statement that hourly workers at the four plants who are retained will be covered by the 1996 master contracts with the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions.\nWages, pensions and benefits for salaried and hourly workers will be about the same as they had been under GM, it said.\nPeregrine will be financed with equity from Joseph Littlejohn &amp; Levy Fund II, a private partnership formed to make investments in consolidating industries and corporate divestitures.\nPeregrine said it does not expect to incur debt other than for working capital needs.\n'

a(S'Labor lawyer James Hoffa, refusing to concede defeat in the Teamsters union presidential election nearly a week after his opponent claimed victory, called Thursday for a congressional investigation into the vote.\nHoffa on Tuesday formally asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to impound the ballots and initiate an FBI investigation into "serious irregularities" in the election.\n"We really have what I call Teamstergate," Hoffa told reporters at a news conference Thursday at the Teamsters\' Detroit offices, where his legendary father, the late Jimmy Hoffa, ruled the union in the 1950s and \'60s.\nIncumbent Teamsters President Ron Carey on Saturday claimed victory in the hard-fought election, winning by an apparent margin of about 17,000 votes. But 41,002 ballots were set aside for further eligibility checks, and Hoffa says more than 25,000 other ballots may have disappeared.\nAfter all eligible votes were tallied late Saturday, court-appointed Election Officer Barbara Zack Quindel accounted for 485,605 mail-in ballots returned. But last week she reported that the total number of ballots received was 511,268, an estimate based on receipts from the U.S. Postal Service.\nHoffa said he wants an explanation for the discrepancy between the ballots counted and the ballots received.\n"If I lost, I lost. I just want a fair election," Hoffa said.\nCarey, 60, was first elected president of the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters as a reformer in 1991. His apparent re-election was lauded by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who had remained neutral during the campaign.\nMeanwhile, Quindel decided Wednesday to void 120 Hoffa votes after finding that a Hoffa backer and former officer of Teamsters Local 743 in Chicago violated election rules by collecting and mailing ballots for other members, according to her spokesman, Jeff O\'Mara.\nActing on a protest filed by Carey\'s campaign last week, O\'Mara said Quindel decided it would be too extreme a remedy to void all of the local\'s ballots.\nThe ballots from Local 743 were among the 41,002 ballots that were being checked for eligibility.\nThe election officer has not disclosed interim results of the tabulation of those ballots and O\'Mara said he did not know when the final tally would be completed.\nBut Hoffa said Thursday that initial tabulations of the so-called challenged ballots have cut Carey\'s lead by as much as 2,400 votes.\nThe Carey campaign, however, said the lead was cut only by about 1,500 votes. The latest count which included the strongly pro-Hoffa Local 743, showed Carey with 230,111 and Hoffa with 214,906 with about 30,000 of the challenged ballots remaining to be processed and counted if found to be eligible, the Carey campaign said.\n'

a(S'Ford Motor Co. on Friday became the second of the U.S. Big Three automakers to align itself with the emerging auto superstore trend by announcing a new agreement with Republic Industries Inc., the parent company of AutoNation USA.\nUnder the agreement, AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The pact also covers areas Ford may want a dealership where it does not currently have one.\nThe move could have implications for the future of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the largest dealer groups in the country, which is reported to be in merger talks with AutoNation.\nFord spokesman John Ochs said Ford has not sold any dealerships to AutoNation. A spokesman for Mullinax, based in Amherst, Ohio, could not be reached for comment.\nMullinax, which owns several large Ford dealerships, was the 11th largest dealer group in the country, based on its 1995 retail unit sales of 20,374 cars and trucks, according to industry trade publication Automotive News.\nLast month, published reports began to surface on talks between Mullinax and AutoNation. The growing auto superstore chain was founded by Wayne Huizenga, who transformed Blockbuster Video into a multibillion-dollar business and owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team.\nFord\'s deal with Republic is a "framework agreement" that opens the door for AutoNation to submit individual proposals, Ochs said. In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford\'s group vice president of marketing and sales, said the automaker believed private entrepreneurs with local community ties will continue to be the "backbone" of its franchise system.\n"However, there will continue to be developments in the industry relating to other types of dealership ownership and distribution methods," he said. "We are working diligently to ensure that the new operators fit into our franchise system."\nThat is a change from last February, when Ford Chairman Alex Trotman told the National Automotible Dealers Association it had no plans to offer a new-car franchise to an auto superstore.\nA year ago, Chrysler Corp. announced it would grant a new-car franchise to CarMax Auto Superstore in Norcross, Ga. CarMax is owned by consumer electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc..\nThe move sent a shockwave through the traditional auto dealer industry, which had already been warily watching the growth of chains such as CarMax and AutoNation in the used-car segment of the business.\nThe new superstores quickly have become popular with consumers because they offer large numbers of newer used cars at haggle-free prices in a pressure-free environment.\nThe Ford announcement signals the superstores will continue to build a presence in the new-car business, analysts said. "That\'s big news," said William Sawyer, vice president of sales in the Detroit office of Polk, a marketing research firm. "It\'s definitely a change for Ford."\nThe move is also noteworthy, he said, because Ford has traditionally been opposed to publicly traded companies owning its franchises.\nGeneral Motors Corp. is the last of the Big Three to not have any franchise agreements with an auto superstore. GM spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the automaker was not opposed to the concept and has held talks with those groups in the past.\n"We\'ve held discussions. We\'ll continue to hold discussions. If one of them wants to purchase a GM dealership, we\'ll review it," he said.\n'

a(S'Sales of light vehicle in December are expected to be down as much as 6 percent from an unusually strong month a year ago, but analysts say the pace was robust enough for 1996\'s total to match industry projections of 15.1 million units.\nGeneral Motors Corp. will endure the largest drop of the Big Three, with the daily sales rate off by an estimated 16 percent from December 1995, according to David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.\nGM\'s sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans -- the light truck category -- will be down significantly, in large part because the automaker is up against a tough comparison from a year ago.\nHowever, car sales will also plunge by as much as 20 percent, estimates Michael Luckey, of Luckey Consulting Group. He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM\'s labor strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.\n"They\'re still being hurt by the strikes," he said. "I think that\'s still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December."\nGM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3. Also reporting Friday is Chrysler Corp., whose sales will be flat or up slightly from December a year ago.\nLight truck sales, which have been accounting for about 70 percent of Chrysler\'s total, are projected to rise 8 percent, offsetting an expected 9 percent slide in passenger car sales, said Healy.\nFord Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.\nFord\'s car sales are forecast to dip 3 percent to 4 percent. Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.\n"If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that," said Luckey.\nFord\'s light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, he said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport/utility.\nImports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.\n"The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars," he said.\nFor December 1996, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.\nHowever, Luckey said the U.S. Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalize the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.\nMost analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.\n"It should be 15.1 million," said Luckey. "That\'s almost certain unless something very strange happens in December."\nThat total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.\n'

a(S'Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported brisk sales of minivans and pickup trucks for August, pushing total U.S. sales for the automaker up 9 percent on a daily selling basis to 186,306.\nThe August total broke a company record for the month of 176,184 set in 1989.\nSales of light trucks, including popular Ram pickups and four-door minivans were 127,870, a 16.7 percent jump that marked the 11th consecutive month of rising light truck sales.\nDomestically produced car sales came in weaker than some analysts had expected, falling 2 percent to 58,255 units.\nChrysler\'s strong light truck sales were helped by incentives on some Jeep sport utility models. Grand Cherokee sales rose 42 percent; Cherokee was up 52 percent; and Wrangler sales shot up 59 percent.\nTotal pickup sales were held back somewhat by low supplies of the Dakota, which is undergoing a model changeover. Dealers have a 35-day supply of the compact pickups -- about half of what the industry considers to be ideal.\nChrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October.\nSteven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July.\nAugust is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers.\n"Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we\'ll have a pretty good month in September," said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August.\nTorok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance.\n"What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern," he said. "Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent."\nAlthough car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler\'s total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance.\nChrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to repoort sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers.\nAlso on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent.\n'

a(S'China is planning to issue rules to speed development of its key power sector with an expanded role for foreign companies, a Chinese planning official said on Tuesday.\nBeijing was reviewing rules governing build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, which so far have been off limits for foreign companies on major power projects, said Wang Hong of the State Planning Commission.\n"The State Council (cabinet) is considering temporary regulations," said Wang, director of the commission\'s department of foreign finance utilisation.\nChina has said it needs $20 billion in foreign capital through the year 2000 to meet its targets for power industry development.\nWang said the BOT rules would not be ready in time for the award of the nation\'s first such power sector project which is expected soon and could cost $600 million to $700 million.\nChina is now evaluating tenders for the Laibin power project in Guangxi province in southern China, which calls for construction and operation of two 350-megawatt power units.\nBeijing says it is using the BOT method on a trial basis.\nThe winner could be announced within the next month, Wang told Reuters at an energy conference.\nMajor bidders include industrial giant ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG of Switzerland and a group including Germany\'s Siemens AG and Hong Kong\'s China Light &amp; Power Co Ltd.\nThe winner would construct and operate the plant for a period of time before turning the plant over to China. Its bid would include a plan for domestic electric power rates.\nThe rules under review would define BOT projects and state when they are acceptable.\nThey would also specify the approval process, require the use of international tenders and determine the apportioning of risk between China and foreign companies, Wang said.\nChina generally does not allow foreign entities to hold than a 30 percent stake in key power projects, which are those with a capacity of about 250 megawatts.\nWestern bankers at the conference said the lack of a clear legal framework for BOT projects coupled with problems in setting domestic electric power rates made it difficult for foreign commercial banks to finance the Laibin project.\n'

a(S'China has vowed to wind up the lengthy probe of the disgraced former boss of Beijing, saying the case had seriously damaged the Communist Party in the nation\'s capital.\nBeijing party chief Chen Xitong stepped down in April last year, only weeks after his protege and vice-mayor Wang Baosen was targeted in a probe of economic crimes and committed suicide.\n"The cases of Chen and Wang absolutely will not just fade away," the Outlook magazine quoted Beijing\'s current party chief, Wei Jianxing, as saying.\n"These cases have had a very bad effect on municipal affairs.. and have destroyed a number of comrades in the party," it quoted Wei -- the Communist Party\'s top graft fighter -- as saying.\nThe weekly magazine, published by the official Xinhua news agency, carried the remarks in its latest edition, seen in Beijing on Wednesday.\nThe 66-year-old Chen has been out of the public eye since his fall from grace, becoming the most prominent victim of a campaign against corruption.\nHe was deprived of his seat on the party\'s powerful Politburo and was officially said to be under investigation for "serious mistakes".\nUnpublished party documents say that Chen, who ran Beijing for 12 years, first as mayor and then as party chief, had abused his office by amassing $24 million in unauthorised funds and lavishing favours on friends, associates and a long-time mistress.\nVice-mayor Wang was found to have used his position to obtain 116 houses illegally and built himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.\nThe inability of investigators to announce a conclusion to their investigation had triggered much speculation, particularly in the case of Chen who was said to be refusing to cooperate and was threatening to implicate others.\nIt also contrasted sharply with the speedy trial and sentencing last week of dissident Wang Dan, who was jailed for 11 years on subversion charges after less than four hours in a Beijing courtroom.\nThe magazine also said that 22 people had been linked to the probe of the late vice-mayor, including Zhou Beifang, the former chairman of Hong Kong listed affiliates of a major Chinese steel company, and Chen Xitong\'s secretary, Chen Jian.\nEarlier this month, prosecutors filed corruption charges against 30 people, including Zhou, who was detained in February last year.\nThe magazine also said that a former senior member of the Beijing city assembly, Tie Ying, had been arrested and expelled from the party earlier this year for accepting a large bribe from a Hong Kong businessman. It did not give further details.\nThe city government had been virtually paralysed since the disgrace of Chen and Wang, Chinese sources have said.\nThe campaign to clean up the Beijing administration was widely believed to have been a factor in the departure last week of Li Qiyan as mayor.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.\nCourts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.\n'

a(S'Asia gave a cautious welcome on Friday to U.S. President Bill Clinton\'s appointments for the key posts of secretaries of state and defence, mixing public praise with some private misgivings.\nU.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, tapped to become the first woman secretary of state, and Senator William Cohen, who would take up the defence post, were seen as able appointees, though both were perceived as short on Asian expertise.\nAnalysts said Asian nations that had been targets of U.S. pressure on human rights might also have cause for new concerns, particularly with the outspoken Albright in the top foreign policy job.\nClinton named his United Nations envoy and the Republican senator from Maine on Thursday as his choices for the Cabinet posts to succeed Warren Christopher and William Perry. Senate confirmation for both nominees was widely expected.\nJapanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he did not foresee any impact on U.S.-Japan relations.\n"I do not expect any changes in U.S.-Japan ties and I hope we can work together to deepen our relations," he told reporters.\nBut government sources said both appointees were unfamilar with Japan and their counterparts in Tokyo would soon begin the task of getting acquainted with them.\nChina, which has seen an easing of its strains with the United States of late, said it welcomed Albright\'s appointment and looked forward to a continuation of improving ties.\n"We congratulate Ms Albright on her nomination as secretary of state," a foreign ministry spokesman said.\n"We hope that while she is secretary of state, China and the United States ... will grasp the opportunities and make mutual efforts to improve and develop Sino-U.S. ties."\nSino-U.S. relations had been buffeted over the past two years by disputes over Taiwan, arms proliferation, trade and human rights. Relations have improved markedly in recent months, most notably with a meeting between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the Philippines last month.\nBut Chinese specialists in U.S. policy issues said a lack of experience in Asian affairs would prove a handicap for the two new Cabinet members, though they expected this to be overcome.\nThey said that human rights issues, still a source of friction, had been put aside for the time being, and were unlikely to upset bilateral ties.\nBurma could be one Asian state to have misgivings about the new post for Albright, particularly in the sphere of human rights, analysts said.\nThere was no official comment from the Burmese government but a Western diplomat in Rangoon said Albright\'s appointment would be viewed negatively as her past statements on human rights and women\'s issues have not been welcome.\nThe United States has also been critical on occasion of Indonesia\'s human rights record though Jakarta\'s reaction to Albright\'s appointment was upbeat. Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas described her as an able and experienced diplomat.\nSouth Korea saw the new U.S. Cabinet appointees as likely to maintain pressure on rival North Korea as both are wary of the potential threat posed by Pyongyang.\n"The U.S. policy of trying to guide North Korea to a soft landing and keeping the freeze on Pyongyang\'s nuclear programme will continue," a government official said.\n"The new team is also likely to promote dialogue between South and North Korea," he added.\nNorth Korea invaded the South in 1950 and the two sides remain technically at war. Hostilities ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\nAlbright won an enthusiastic response from some quarters, such as in the Philippines where she was called an inspiration to women worldwide.\n"I am glad that the United States showed the way," said Katrina Legarda, one of the country\'s prominent women lawyers.\n"This development is so rare," she said.\n'
